L1045,L1045,u0,m0,BIANCA,"They do not!
"
L1044,L1044,u2,m0,CAMERON,"They do to!
"
L985,L985,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I hope so.
"
L984,L984,u2,m0,CAMERON,"She okay?
"
L925,L925,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Let's go.
"
L924,L924,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Wow
"
L872,L872,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
"
L871,L871,u2,m0,CAMERON,"No
"
L870,L870,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this ""persona""?  And you don't know how to quit?
"
L869,L869,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Like my fear of wearing pastels?
"
L868,L868,u2,m0,CAMERON,"The ""real you"".
"
L867,L867,u0,m0,BIANCA,"What good stuff?
"
L866,L866,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
"
L865,L865,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
"
L864,L864,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
"
L863,L863,u2,m0,CAMERON,"What crap?
"
L862,L862,u0,m0,BIANCA,"do you listen to this crap?
"
L861,L861,u2,m0,CAMERON,"No...
"
L860,L860,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210.""
"
L699,L699,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You always been this selfish?
"
L698,L698,u0,m0,BIANCA,"But
"
L697,L697,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Then that's all you had to say.
"
L696,L696,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Well, no...
"
L695,L695,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
"
L694,L694,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I was?
"
L693,L693,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be ""occupied"".
"
L663,L663,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Tons
"
L662,L662,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Have fun tonight?
"
L578,L578,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I believe we share an art instructor
"
L577,L577,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You know Chastity?
"
L576,L576,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
"
L575,L575,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Hi.
"
L407,L407,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
"
L406,L406,u2,m0,CAMERON,"So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
"
L405,L405,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
"
L404,L404,u2,m0,CAMERON,"She's not a...
"
L403,L403,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
"
L402,L402,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
"
L401,L401,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Sure have.
"
L368,L368,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
"
L367,L367,u2,m0,CAMERON,"How do you get your hair to look like that?
"
L366,L366,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You're sweet.
"
L365,L365,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You have my word.  As a gentleman
"
L364,L364,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
"
L363,L363,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You got something on your mind?
"
L281,L281,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Where?
"
L280,L280,u2,m0,CAMERON,"There.
"
L277,L277,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Well, there's someone I think might be --
"
L276,L276,u0,m0,BIANCA,"How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
"
L275,L275,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Forget French.
"
L274,L274,u2,m0,CAMERON,"That's because it's such a nice one.
"
L273,L273,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
"
L272,L272,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
"
L271,L271,u0,m0,BIANCA,"C'esc ma tete. This is my head
"
L208,L208,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Let me see what I can do.
"
L207,L207,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
"
L206,L206,u2,m0,CAMERON,"That's a shame.
"
L205,L205,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
"
L204,L204,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Why?
"
L203,L203,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
"
L202,L202,u0,m0,BIANCA,"The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
"
L201,L201,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Cameron.
"
L200,L200,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
"
L199,L199,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Forget it.
"
L198,L198,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
"
L197,L197,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
"
L196,L196,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
"
L195,L195,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
"
L194,L194,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
"
L953,L953,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I did.
"
L659,L659,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I have to be home in twenty minutes.
"
L599,L599,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
"
L597,L597,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
"
L595,L595,u0,m0,BIANCA,"He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
"
L580,L580,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
"
L573,L573,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Joey.
"
L571,L571,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Where did he go?  He was just here.
"
L51,L51,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You might wanna think about it
"
L49,L49,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Did you change your hair?
"
L760,L760,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
"
L757,L757,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Hi, Joey.
"
L592,L592,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Neat...
"
L590,L590,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Queen Harry?
"
L397,L397,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Hopefully.
"
L395,L395,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Expensive?
"
L1051,L1051,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Patrick -- is that- a.
"
L1021,L1021,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
"
L1011,L1011,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No! I just wanted
"
L1009,L1009,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I just wanted --
"
L1007,L1007,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Let go!
"
L982,L982,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You looked beautiful last night, you know.
"
L914,L914,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I guess I'll never know, will I?
"
L912,L912,u0,m0,BIANCA,"God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
"
L910,L910,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
"
L908,L908,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
"
L906,L906,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Why didn't you tell me?
"
L904,L904,u0,m0,BIANCA,"But
"
L902,L902,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You did what?
"
L900,L900,u0,m0,BIANCA,"As in...
"
L898,L898,u0,m0,BIANCA,"But you hate Joey
"
L896,L896,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Why?
"
L894,L894,u0,m0,BIANCA,"What?
"
L892,L892,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
"
L890,L890,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Like you care.
"
L655,L655,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
"
L602,L602,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
"
L542,L542,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You are so completely unbalanced.
"
L533,L533,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
"
L531,L531,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
"
L529,L529,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
"
L527,L527,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
"
L525,L525,u0,m0,BIANCA,"You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
"
L445,L445,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
"
L443,L443,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
"
L441,L441,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
"
L320,L320,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Can you at least start wearing a bra?
"
L165,L165,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
"
L923,L923,u0,m0,BIANCA,"I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
"
L884,L884,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
"
L882,L882,u0,m0,BIANCA,"He's not a ""hot rod"".  Whatever that is.
"
L880,L880,u0,m0,BIANCA,"No, but
"
L878,L878,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
"
L545,L545,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Why?
"
L539,L539,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, no!
"
L537,L537,u0,m0,BIANCA,"It's just a party. Daddy.
"
L523,L523,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, people expect me to be there!
"
L521,L521,u0,m0,BIANCA,"It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria Steinem"" over there isn't going --
"
L519,L519,u0,m0,BIANCA,"If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
"
L517,L517,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Daddy, I --
"
L189,L189,u0,m0,BIANCA,"But she doesn't want to date.
"
L183,L183,u0,m0,BIANCA,"But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
"
L181,L181,u0,m0,BIANCA,"What if she never starts dating?
"
L179,L179,u0,m0,BIANCA,"Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
"
L778,L778,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
"
L586,L586,u2,m0,CAMERON,"No, I ' m not.
"
L584,L584,u2,m0,CAMERON,"The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
"
L500,L500,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
"
L433,L433,u2,m0,CAMERON,"It's her favorite band.
"
L425,L425,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Okay!  I wasn't sure
"
L418,L418,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Her favorite uncle
"
L416,L416,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Number one.  She hates smokers
"
L390,L390,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Will Bogey get bent?
"
L388,L388,u2,m0,CAMERON,"This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
"
L244,L244,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You got him involved?
"
L224,L224,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I thought you hated those people.
"
L222,L222,u2,m0,CAMERON,"That's what I just said
"
L220,L220,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
"
L218,L218,u2,m0,CAMERON,"They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
"
L216,L216,u2,m0,CAMERON,"He seems like he thrives on danger
"
L212,L212,u2,m0,CAMERON,"What about him?
"
L210,L210,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
"
L158,L158,u2,m0,CAMERON,"That's her?  Bianca's sister?
"
L146,L146,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
"
L144,L144,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
"
L141,L141,u2,m0,CAMERON,"He always have that shit-eating grin?
"
L139,L139,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
"
L91,L91,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Why not?
"
L89,L89,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Who is she?
"
L87,L87,u2,m0,CAMERON,"That girl -- I --
"
L77,L77,u2,m0,CAMERON,"That I'm used to.
"
L73,L73,u2,m0,CAMERON,"How many people go here?
"
L71,L71,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Thirty-two.
"
L69,L69,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
"
L67,L67,u2,m0,CAMERON,"North, actually.  How'd you   ?
"
L64,L64,u2,m0,CAMERON,"So they tell me...
"
L781,L781,u2,m0,CAMERON,"You get the girl.
"
L744,L744,u2,m0,CAMERON,"She kissed me.
"
L740,L740,u2,m0,CAMERON,"She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
"
L725,L725,u2,m0,CAMERON,"What'd you do to her?
"
L624,L624,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Sure
"
L622,L622,u2,m0,CAMERON,"She's partial to Joey, not me
"
L620,L620,u2,m0,CAMERON,"It's off. The whole thing.
"
L430,L430,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
"
L426,L426,u2,m0,CAMERON,"Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion"".
"
L412,L412,u2,m0,CAMERON,"I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
"
L385,L385,u2,m0,CAMERON,"And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
"
L450758,L450758,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"He's not really my uncle.
"
L450755,L450755,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
"
L450753,L450753,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well... I might be going out to dinner.
"
L450751,L450751,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Georgia.
"
L450867,L450867,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
"
L450865,L450865,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"We can reach an understanding on this.
"
L450850,L450850,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
"
L450848,L450848,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're not getting any navy contracts.
"
L450842,L450842,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Twenty-five percent.
"
L450995,L450995,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You don't know anything about me.
"
L450993,L450993,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It's... it's not like that.
"
L450991,L450991,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No.
"
L450988,L450988,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Please, we hardly know each other.
"
L450986,L450986,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
"
L451190,L451190,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Who indeed...
"
L451187,L451187,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What?
"
L450734,L450734,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You what?
"
L450731,L450731,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Not with those smokestacks it's not.
"
L450729,L450729,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What's that long building over there?
"
L451215,L451215,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
"
L451213,L451213,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
"
L451208,L451208,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
"
L451206,L451206,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"How?
"
L451202,L451202,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
"
L451200,L451200,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
"
L451136,L451136,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're making the right decision, sir.
"
L451134,L451134,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"<u>Expected</u>... offer.
"
L451127,L451127,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"How are you, Mr. Kross.
"
L450860,L450860,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
"
L450858,L450858,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
"
L450856,L450856,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No.  What I have is a lot of money.
"
L450854,L450854,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
"
L450846,L450846,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
"
L451256,L451256,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
"
L451255,L451255,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian...
"
L451254,L451254,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I didn't think so.
"
L451253,L451253,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
"
L451252,L451252,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
"
L451251,L451251,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Aw, don't... no...
"
L451250,L451250,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
"
L451249,L451249,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're packing.
"
L451248,L451248,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It felt good.
"
L451247,L451247,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It was good.
"
L451246,L451246,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I got tired of hating my father.
"
L451245,L451245,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It was a business decision.
"
L451244,L451244,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
"
L451243,L451243,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
"
L451242,L451242,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
"
L451153,L451153,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
"
L451152,L451152,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
"
L451151,L451151,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Yes.  The man made a business decision.
"
L451150,L451150,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Business.
"
L451149,L451149,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
"
L451148,L451148,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Right.
"
L451147,L451147,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
"
L451146,L451146,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
"
L451145,L451145,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What do you mean?
"
L451144,L451144,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What did you do to him?
"
L451125,L451125,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You just did.
"
L451124,L451124,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I've never treated you like a whore.
"
L451123,L451123,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
"
L451122,L451122,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
"
L451121,L451121,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, ""Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo.""
"
L451120,L451120,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, I've thought about this a lot.  This is the best solution.
"
L451119,L451119,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
"
L451118,L451118,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
"
L451117,L451117,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
"
L451116,L451116,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I have to go to New York tomorrow.
"
L451115,L451115,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
"
L451114,L451114,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"One more night and you're finally rid of me.
"
L451101,L451101,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
"
L451100,L451100,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Did you?
"
L451099,L451099,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I know.  I'm glad.
"
L451098,L451098,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I more than liked it.
"
L451097,L451097,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
"
L451091,L451091,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
"
L451090,L451090,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"But don't they have it in English?
"
L451089,L451089,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
"
L451088,L451088,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
"
L451082,L451082,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What happened to him?
"
L451081,L451081,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
"
L451080,L451080,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
"
L451079,L451079,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
"
L451075,L451075,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
"
L451074,L451074,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I've never been on a plane before.
"
L451073,L451073,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"The opera.
"
L451072,L451072,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Huh?
"
L451071,L451071,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
"
L451070,L451070,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Where are you taking me!?
"
L451069,L451069,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
"
L451065,L451065,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'll guard them and you with my life.
"
L451064,L451064,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What if someone tries to steal it?
"
L451063,L451063,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You won't.
"
L451062,L451062,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What if I lose it?
"
L451061,L451061,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Shush.  Of course you can.
"
L451060,L451060,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Edward, I can't.
"
L451058,L451058,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
"
L451057,L451057,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What's that?
"
L451056,L451056,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
"
L451055,L451055,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Do I look okay?
"
L451044,L451044,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I really am sorry.
"
L451043,L451043,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
"
L451042,L451042,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
"
L451041,L451041,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
"
L451040,L451040,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Fuck off.
"
L451039,L451039,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
"
L451038,L451038,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
"
L451037,L451037,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian...
"
L451036,L451036,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
"
L451035,L451035,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
"
L451034,L451034,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
"
L451033,L451033,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
"
L451032,L451032,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
"
L451031,L451031,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Stuckey!  He wants an ""appointment"" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
"
L451030,L451030,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
"
L451029,L451029,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
"
L451028,L451028,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I don't know what you're talking about.
"
L451027,L451027,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
"
L451026,L451026,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, what the --
"
L451025,L451025,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
"
L450982,L450982,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Ready to stomp sod?
"
L450981,L450981,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
"
L450980,L450980,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm sure that's true for some of them.
"
L450979,L450979,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
"
L450966,L450966,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Shall we mingle?
"
L450965,L450965,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
"
L450964,L450964,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"He's good at what he does.
"
L450963,L450963,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Real genuine guy.
"
L450955,L450955,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You did.
"
L450954,L450954,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
"
L450953,L450953,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What id we run into someone I know?
"
L450952,L450952,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I think it's exciting.
"
L450951,L450951,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
"
L450946,L450946,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"He died a long time ago.
"
L450945,L450945,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You still mad at'm?
"
L450944,L450944,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
"
L450943,L450943,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
"
L450942,L450942,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
"
L450941,L450941,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
"
L450940,L450940,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No.
"
L450939,L450939,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You always been rich?
"
L450938,L450938,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Dinner can wait.
"
L450937,L450937,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What about dinner?
"
L450936,L450936,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Please.
"
L450935,L450935,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
"
L450934,L450934,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
"
L450933,L450933,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
"
L450896,L450896,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Come with me?
"
L450895,L450895,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Good.
"
L450894,L450894,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Okay.
"
L450893,L450893,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, you belong wherever you are.  I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
"
L450892,L450892,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
"
L450891,L450891,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Was someone rude to you?
"
L450890,L450890,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
"
L450889,L450889,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Why not?
"
L450888,L450888,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
"
L450887,L450887,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
"
L450885,L450885,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Uh-uh.  No work.
"
L450884,L450884,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I have work to do.
"
L450883,L450883,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
"
L450882,L450882,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Television?
"
L450881,L450881,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
"
L450879,L450879,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
"
L450878,L450878,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
"
L450877,L450877,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You liked the guy, though.
"
L450876,L450876,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
"
L450875,L450875,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're upset, huh?
"
L450870,L450870,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
"
L450869,L450869,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"And that's the way the game is played.
"
L450838,L450838,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're forgiven.
"
L450837,L450837,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm sorry.
"
L450784,L450784,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh!
"
L450783,L450783,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
"
L450782,L450782,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hello?
"
L450781,L450781,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Thank you <u>very much</u>.
"
L450780,L450780,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
"
L450779,L450779,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I think you'll approve.
"
L450778,L450778,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Any good?
"
L450777,L450777,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"The Rex.
"
L450776,L450776,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
"
L450775,L450775,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"This isn't a date.
"
L450774,L450774,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No, I don't ""got it"".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
"
L450773,L450773,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
"
L450772,L450772,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
"
L450771,L450771,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
"
L450770,L450770,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I got a dress, yeah.
"
L450769,L450769,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Did you buy some clothes?
"
L450768,L450768,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
"
L450767,L450767,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Never answer the phone.  Ever.
"
L450671,L450671,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
"
L450670,L450670,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
"
L450669,L450669,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm not just talking about sex.
"
L450668,L450668,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Holy shit.
"
L450667,L450667,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Done.
"
L450666,L450666,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Three.
"
L450665,L450665,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"All right, two thousand.
"
L450664,L450664,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"But you want days too.
"
L450663,L450663,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
"
L450662,L450662,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Four thousand.
"
L450661,L450661,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Five full nights... days too?
"
L450660,L450660,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Of course.  How much?
"
L450659,L450659,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It'd cost you.
"
L450657,L450657,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm in town until Saturday.
"
L450656,L450656,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What?
"
L450655,L450655,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"All right.  How much for the week?
"
L450644,L450644,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Don't drown.
"
L450643,L450643,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
"
L450642,L450642,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Where'd you learn to do this?
"
L450641,L450641,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
"
L450640,L450640,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Not... quite.
"
L450639,L450639,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
"
L450638,L450638,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
"
L450637,L450637,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
"
L450636,L450636,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian --
"
L450635,L450635,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What are assets?
"
L450634,L450634,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"By breaking up a company's assets --
"
L450633,L450633,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What?  Why?
"
L450632,L450632,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I sell them.
"
L450631,L450631,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
"
L450630,L450630,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"... dollars?
"
L450629,L450629,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
"
L450628,L450628,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No shit.  They expensive?
"
L450627,L450627,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I buy companies.
"
L450626,L450626,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"""Occupational hazard"".
"
L450625,L450625,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No?  Why's that?
"
L450624,L450624,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
"
L450623,L450623,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Do you ever... enjoy it?
"
L450622,L450622,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'd say you give a good dollar value.
"
L450621,L450621,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
"
L450620,L450620,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Mmm, I could tell.
"
L450619,L450619,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
"
L450618,L450618,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
"
L450617,L450617,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Where'd you go?
"
L450616,L450616,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Occupational hazard?
"
L450615,L450615,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
"
L450614,L450614,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Did you sleep well?
"
L450612,L450612,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No hurry.  Would you like some breakfast?
"
L450611,L450611,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
"
L450610,L450610,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Good morning.
"
L450599,L450599,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
"
L450598,L450598,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What do you like?
"
L450596,L450596,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Yes...
"
L450595,L450595,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Just a romantic, that's you.
"
L450594,L450594,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You really are a very beautiful girl.
"
L450593,L450593,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
"
L450592,L450592,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
"
L450591,L450591,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
"
L450590,L450590,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Why?
"
L450589,L450589,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Try a strawberry.
"
L450588,L450588,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh, thank god.
"
L450587,L450587,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"It's a very good year.
"
L450586,L450586,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"They should be.  They're both good at it.
"
L450585,L450585,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Where are they?  Shopping together?
"
L450583,L450583,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
"
L450582,L450582,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I think he wanted you to tip him.
"
L450575,L450575,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I've known a lot of everybody.
"
L450574,L450574,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
"
L450573,L450573,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
"
L450572,L450572,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"And why do you say that?
"
L450571,L450571,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
"
L450570,L450570,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Uh-huh.
"
L450569,L450569,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Right.  So!  In town on business?
"
L450568,L450568,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Let's talk some more first.
"
L450567,L450567,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Fair enough.
"
L450566,L450566,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
"
L450565,L450565,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Always.
"
L450564,L450564,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Do you plan everything?
"
L450563,L450563,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
"
L450560,L450560,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
"
L450559,L450559,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Can I have some chips?
"
L450558,L450558,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
"
L450557,L450557,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Diet coke.
"
L450556,L450556,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Room service.  What do you drink?
"
L450549,L450549,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Exactly.
"
L450548,L450548,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Off the boulevard.
"
L450547,L450547,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
"
L450546,L450546,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You mean they don't have hookers.
"
L450545,L450545,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
"
L450544,L450544,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Why?
"
L450543,L450543,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
"
L450541,L450541,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
"
L450540,L450540,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Better believe it.
"
L450539,L450539,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You know how to drive a stick?
"
L450538,L450538,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What?
"
L450537,L450537,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Get in.  This side.
"
L450536,L450536,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Edward... you got it!
"
L450535,L450535,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Edward.  My name is Edward.
"
L450534,L450534,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What's your name, lover.
"
L450533,L450533,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Fine.
"
L450532,L450532,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Three hundred.
"
L450530,L450530,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You couldn't afford it.
"
L450529,L450529,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
"
L450528,L450528,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No, but it's getting there.
"
L450527,L450527,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
"
L450526,L450526,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I never joke about money.
"
L450525,L450525,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're joking.
"
L450524,L450524,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"For an hour.
"
L450523,L450523,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"For the whole night?
"
L450522,L450522,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
"
L450521,L450521,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What do you charge for company, Vivian?
"
L450519,L450519,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
"
L450518,L450518,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Ugly habit, biting your nails.
"
L450517,L450517,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean to.
"
L450516,L450516,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
"
L450515,L450515,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
"
L450514,L450514,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
"
L450513,L450513,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
"
L450512,L450512,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
"
L450511,L450511,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"So do day jobs.
"
L450510,L450510,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It pays.
"
L450509,L450509,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You like being a hooker, Vivian?
"
L450508,L450508,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
"
L450507,L450507,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What's your name?
"
L450506,L450506,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
"
L450505,L450505,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
"
L450504,L450504,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
"
L450503,L450503,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"<u>Ho</u>tel.
"
L450502,L450502,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What motel you staying at?
"
L450501,L450501,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"New York.
"
L450500,L450500,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You're not from L.A., huh?
"
L450499,L450499,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
"
L450498,L450498,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"If you can figure it out, be my guest.
"
L450497,L450497,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Mind if I turn on some heat?
"
L450496,L450496,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Not exactly.
"
L450495,L450495,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Stolen?
"
L450494,L450494,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No.
"
L450493,L450493,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Nice car.  Yours?
"
L450490,L450490,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
"
L450489,L450489,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Sit... and spin.
"
L450488,L450488,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
"
L450487,L450487,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"The price just went up to ten.
"
L450486,L450486,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"That's ridiculous.
"
L450485,L450485,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Sure.  For five bucks.
"
L450484,L450484,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
"
L450483,L450483,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
"
L450482,L450482,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No, you look like a hooker.
"
L450481,L450481,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
"
L450480,L450480,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Yes.
"
L450479,L450479,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
"
L450478,L450478,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
"
L450477,L450477,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You looking' for some company?
"
L450476,L450476,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What's that?
"
L450475,L450475,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
"
L451053,L451053,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Afternoon.
"
L450834,L450834,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Thank you.
"
L450830,L450830,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"My what?
"
L450828,L450828,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
"
L451239,L451239,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Yes.
"
L451237,L451237,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
"
L451235,L451235,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
"
L451217,L451217,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Have a good day, gentlemen.
"
L451210,L451210,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
"
L451204,L451204,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Let him answer.
"
L451109,L451109,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Give me twenty minutes.
"
L451107,L451107,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Why?
"
L451105,L451105,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm up.
"
L451050,L451050,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Goodbye, Bill.
"
L451048,L451048,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
"
L451012,L451012,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker.  I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
"
L451010,L451010,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"You're being ridiculous.
"
L451008,L451008,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
"
L451006,L451006,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Why do you want to know?
"
L451004,L451004,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Vivian's in sales.
"
L451002,L451002,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Yes...
"
L451000,L451000,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
"
L450998,L450998,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"We just did.
"
L450958,L450958,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
"
L450929,L450929,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
"
L450913,L450913,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Do it.
"
L450911,L450911,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
"
L450909,L450909,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
"
L450907,L450907,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
"
L450749,L450749,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No one you know.
"
L450747,L450747,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"What time's diner tonight?
"
L450742,L450742,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
"
L450652,L450652,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'm here.
"
L450609,L450609,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'll bring it back.
"
L450607,L450607,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
"
L450605,L450605,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
"
L450603,L450603,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"I want to.
"
L450419,L450419,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Love this car!  Is it new?
"
L450415,L450415,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"No.
"
L450413,L450413,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Really?  Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do?  No, thank you.  I just got off the phone with one.
"
L450411,L450411,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
"
L450409,L450409,u7133,m479,EDWARD,"Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
"
L451294,L451294,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
"
L451292,L451292,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
"
L451290,L451290,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Couple a hours.
"
L451288,L451288,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You sure you won't come with me?
"
L451286,L451286,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Want a pair of boots?
"
L451284,L451284,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
"
L451282,L451282,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
"
L451184,L451184,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
"
L451182,L451182,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
"
L451180,L451180,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
"
L451178,L451178,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"It was great.
"
L451176,L451176,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
"
L451174,L451174,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
"
L451172,L451172,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
"
L451170,L451170,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah... I know what you mean.
"
L451168,L451168,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Kit...
"
L451165,L451165,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
"
L451163,L451163,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Who did you think?
"
L451161,L451161,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
"
L450692,L450692,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah.
"
L450690,L450690,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
"
L450688,L450688,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
"
L450686,L450686,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"He... he just does.
"
L450684,L450684,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
"
L450682,L450682,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Kit!  Where've you been?
"
L450470,L450470,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"He's not gonna want us.
"
L450468,L450468,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
"
L450466,L450466,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
"
L450464,L450464,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Looks slow tonight.
"
L450459,L450459,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"No, let's go to work.  Okay?
"
L450457,L450457,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
"
L450455,L450455,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
"
L450453,L450453,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
"
L450445,L450445,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I bet.  That was our rent!
"
L450440,L450440,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
"
L450427,L450427,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You bullshittin' me?
"
L450425,L450425,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
"
L450423,L450423,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, what?
"
L450794,L450794,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
"
L450792,L450792,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Oooh, I love those.
"
L450790,L450790,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
"
L450788,L450788,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Okay.
"
L450786,L450786,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What?
"
L451266,L451266,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
"
L451264,L451264,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, well, I check out today.
"
L451262,L451262,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
"
L451260,L451260,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hi, Barney!
"
L451158,L451158,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Me?
"
L450821,L450821,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Professionally?
"
L450819,L450819,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
"
L450817,L450817,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Steak spoon! 
"
L450815,L450815,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I like steak.
"
L450813,L450813,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"But what if they serve soup?
"
L450811,L450811,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What if they serve soup?
"
L450809,L450809,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
"
L450807,L450807,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"But I always eat like this.
"
L450803,L450803,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
"
L450801,L450801,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Will I like it?
"
L450799,L450799,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
"
L450797,L450797,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
"
L450764,L450764,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
"
L450762,L450762,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
"
L450760,L450760,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I got a dress.
"
L450722,L450722,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Niece?
"
L450720,L450720,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Vivian.
"
L450712,L450712,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I... Edward...
"
L450710,L450710,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm -- I'm with a friend.
"
L450708,L450708,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm just going to my room.
"
L450924,L450924,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I was in here yesterday.
"
L450922,L450922,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Do you remember me?
"
L450920,L450920,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"'Scume me.
"
L450705,L450705,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
"
L450703,L450703,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What is with you?
"
L450701,L450701,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
"
L450699,L450699,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
"
L450697,L450697,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yes.  Something... conservative.
"
L450695,L450695,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I'm just looking, thanks.
"
L451230,L451230,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Get out!
"
L451228,L451228,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
"
L451226,L451226,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"I think it's great.
"
L451022,L451022,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
"
L451020,L451020,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"What?
"
L451018,L451018,u7142,m479,VIVIAN,"Yeah.  Thanks.
"
L119167,L119167,u667,m42,RICK,"-- He's just a lucky guy.
"
L119142,L119142,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
"
L119140,L119140,u667,m42,RICK,"Go back to Bulgaria.
"
L119138,L119138,u667,m42,RICK,"You want my advice?
"
L119136,L119136,u667,m42,RICK,"Nobody ever loved me that much.
"
L119134,L119134,u667,m42,RICK,"He always has.
"
L119132,L119132,u667,m42,RICK,"And you want to know --
"
L119130,L119130,u667,m42,RICK,"And he is still willing to give you a visa?
"
L119128,L119128,u667,m42,RICK,"Does he know that?
"
L119126,L119126,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I'll bet.
"
L119124,L119124,u667,m42,RICK,"So you decided to go to America.
"
L119122,L119122,u667,m42,RICK,"How long have you been married?
"
L119120,L119120,u667,m42,RICK,"I thought so. Where's your husband?
"
L119118,L119118,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
"
L119116,L119116,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
"
L119113,L119113,u667,m42,RICK,"No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
"
L119112,L119112,u667,m42,RICK,"He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
"
L119110,L119110,u667,m42,RICK,"I should have known.
"
L119108,L119108,u667,m42,RICK,"How did you get in here? You're under age.
"
L119106,L119106,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes?
"
L119328,L119328,u667,m42,RICK,"I want you to take Miss Lund home.
"
L119326,L119326,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Tonight he forgot.
"
L119324,L119324,u667,m42,RICK,"I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
"
L119322,L119322,u667,m42,RICK,"Come up here a minute.
"
L119268,L119268,u667,m42,RICK,"Goodnight.
"
L119266,L119266,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Don't tell me where you're going.
"
L119264,L119264,u667,m42,RICK,"Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
"
L119262,L119262,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
"
L119260,L119260,u667,m42,RICK,"How long can I afford to stay closed?
"
L119169,L119169,u667,m42,RICK,"No thanks, Carl.
"
L118537,L118537,u667,m42,RICK,"That's all right.
"
L118535,L118535,u667,m42,RICK,"Here you are.
"
L118522,L118522,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
"
L118520,L118520,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, I'll get it from the safe.
"
L119386,L119386,u667,m42,RICK,"Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
"
L119385,L119385,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, so long.
"
L119383,L119383,u667,m42,RICK,"And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
"
L119381,L119381,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
"
L119379,L119379,u667,m42,RICK,"It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
"
L118983,L118983,u667,m42,RICK,"That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
"
L118982,L118982,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
"
L118980,L118980,u667,m42,RICK,"I'll tell him when he comes in.
"
L118978,L118978,u667,m42,RICK,"And the carrying charges?
"
L118976,L118976,u667,m42,RICK,"So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
"
L118974,L118974,u667,m42,RICK,"Practically no one.
"
L118972,L118972,u667,m42,RICK,"You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
"
L118969,L118969,u667,m42,RICK,"I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
"
L118967,L118967,u667,m42,RICK,"I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
"
L118472,L118472,u667,m42,RICK,"Suppose we do.
"
L118470,L118470,u667,m42,RICK,"Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
"
L118468,L118468,u667,m42,RICK,"I don't buy or sell human beings.
"
L118466,L118466,u667,m42,RICK,"It's not for sale at any price.
"
L118464,L118464,u667,m42,RICK,"It's not for sale.
"
L118462,L118462,u667,m42,RICK,"Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
"
L119228,L119228,u664,m42,ILSA,"And the other alternative?
"
L119226,L119226,u664,m42,ILSA,"What are they?
"
L119224,L119224,u664,m42,ILSA,"What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
"
L119222,L119222,u664,m42,ILSA,"Occupied France?
"
L119220,L119220,u664,m42,ILSA,"This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
"
L118929,L118929,u664,m42,ILSA,"You needn't be concerned about me.
"
L119471,L119471,u667,m42,RICK,"She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
"
L119470,L119470,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes.
"
L119462,L119462,u667,m42,RICK,"And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
"
L119461,L119461,u664,m42,ILSA,"And I said I would never leave you.
"
L119460,L119460,u667,m42,RICK,"We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
"
L119459,L119459,u664,m42,ILSA,"But what about us?
"
L119458,L119458,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
"
L119457,L119457,u664,m42,ILSA,"No.
"
L119456,L119456,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
"
L119453,L119453,u667,m42,RICK,"-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
"
L119452,L119452,u664,m42,ILSA,"But Richard, no, I, I --
"
L119451,L119451,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
"
L119450,L119450,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
"
L119449,L119449,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
"
L119448,L119448,u664,m42,ILSA,"I don't understand. What about you?
"
L119447,L119447,u667,m42,RICK,"Because you're getting on that plane.
"
L119446,L119446,u664,m42,ILSA,"But why my name, Richard?
"
L119406,L119406,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, Rick!
"
L119405,L119405,u667,m42,RICK,"Everything is quite all right.
"
L119404,L119404,u664,m42,ILSA,"But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
"
L119403,L119403,u667,m42,RICK,"No, not yet.
"
L119402,L119402,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
"
L119313,L119313,u664,m42,ILSA,"I wish I didn't love you so much.
"
L119312,L119312,u667,m42,RICK,"All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
"
L119311,L119311,u664,m42,ILSA,"I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
"
L119310,L119310,u667,m42,RICK,"All except one. He won't have you.
"
L119309,L119309,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
"
L119308,L119308,u667,m42,RICK,"And Laszlo?
"
L119307,L119307,u664,m42,ILSA,"Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
"
L119306,L119306,u667,m42,RICK,"Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
"
L119305,L119305,u664,m42,ILSA,"Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
"
L119304,L119304,u667,m42,RICK,"When did you first find out he was alive?
"
L119303,L119303,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
"
L119302,L119302,u667,m42,RICK,"Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
"
L119301,L119301,u664,m42,ILSA,"It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: ""Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp."" I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
"
L119300,L119300,u667,m42,RICK,"And then?
"
L119296,L119296,u667,m42,RICK,"If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
"
L119295,L119295,u664,m42,ILSA,"For the last time, put them on the table.
"
L119294,L119294,u667,m42,RICK,"No.
"
L119293,L119293,u664,m42,ILSA,"Put them on the table.
"
L119292,L119292,u667,m42,RICK,"I don't have to. I've got them right here.
"
L119291,L119291,u664,m42,ILSA,"-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
"
L119289,L119289,u667,m42,RICK,"What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
"
L119288,L119288,u664,m42,ILSA,"No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
"
L119286,L119286,u667,m42,RICK,"-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
"
L119285,L119285,u664,m42,ILSA,"Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
"
L119284,L119284,u667,m42,RICK,"-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
"
L119283,L119283,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
"
L119282,L119282,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
"
L119281,L119281,u664,m42,ILSA,"It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
"
L119280,L119280,u667,m42,RICK,"Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
"
L119279,L119279,u664,m42,ILSA,"I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
"
L119278,L119278,u667,m42,RICK,"I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
"
L119277,L119277,u664,m42,ILSA,"You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
"
L119276,L119276,u667,m42,RICK,"Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
"
L119275,L119275,u664,m42,ILSA,"Please.
"
L119274,L119274,u667,m42,RICK,"You use ""Richard"" again? We're back in Paris.
"
L119273,L119273,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, I had to see you.
"
L119272,L119272,u667,m42,RICK,"I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
"
L119271,L119271,u664,m42,ILSA,"The stairs from the street.
"
L119270,L119270,u667,m42,RICK,"How did you get in?
"
L119009,L119009,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
"
L119008,L119008,u667,m42,RICK,"All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
"
L119007,L119007,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
"
L119006,L119006,u664,m42,ILSA,"You can believe that if you want to.
"
L119005,L119005,u667,m42,RICK,"Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
"
L119004,L119004,u664,m42,ILSA,"Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
"
L119003,L119003,u667,m42,RICK,"Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
"
L119002,L119002,u664,m42,ILSA,"I don't think I will, Rick.
"
L119001,L119001,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
"
L119000,L119000,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes.
"
L118999,L118999,u667,m42,RICK,"Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
"
L118993,L118993,u664,m42,ILSA,"It doesn't matter.
"
L118992,L118992,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
"
L118909,L118909,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, ""Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid,"" it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
"
L118908,L118908,u664,m42,ILSA,"It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
"
L118907,L118907,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
"
L118906,L118906,u664,m42,ILSA,"I don't know the finish yet.
"
L118905,L118905,u667,m42,RICK,"Has it got a wow finish?
"
L118904,L118904,u664,m42,ILSA,"Can I tell you a story, Rick?
"
L118903,L118903,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
"
L118902,L118902,u664,m42,ILSA,"I didn't count the days.
"
L118901,L118901,u667,m42,RICK,"Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
"
L118900,L118900,u664,m42,ILSA,"Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
"
L118899,L118899,u667,m42,RICK,"It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. ""Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop.""
"
L118898,L118898,u664,m42,ILSA,"I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
"
L118897,L118897,u667,m42,RICK,"Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
"
L118896,L118896,u664,m42,ILSA,"Please.
"
L118895,L118895,u667,m42,RICK,"Especially tonight.
"
L118894,L118894,u664,m42,ILSA,"No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
"
L118893,L118893,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
"
L118887,L118887,u664,m42,ILSA,"I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
"
L118886,L118886,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
"
L118885,L118885,u664,m42,ILSA,"Oh, darling!
"
L118884,L118884,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
"
L118883,L118883,u664,m42,ILSA,"That's too far ahead to plan.
"
L118882,L118882,u667,m42,RICK,"All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
"
L118881,L118881,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
"
L118880,L118880,u667,m42,RICK,"-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
"
L118879,L118879,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, of course, we --
"
L118878,L118878,u667,m42,RICK,"No, no, no, no. We must leave.
"
L118877,L118877,u664,m42,ILSA,"But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
"
L118876,L118876,u667,m42,RICK,"I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
"
L118875,L118875,u664,m42,ILSA,"Strange. I know so very little about you.
"
L118871,L118871,u667,m42,RICK,"Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
"
L118870,L118870,u664,m42,ILSA,"Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
"
L118869,L118869,u667,m42,RICK,"Looking for a job.
"
L118868,L118868,u664,m42,ILSA,"Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
"
L118867,L118867,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
"
L118866,L118866,u664,m42,ILSA,"With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
"
L118865,L118865,u664,m42,ILSA,"It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
"
L118864,L118864,u667,m42,RICK,"My German's a little rusty.
"
L118860,L118860,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
"
L118859,L118859,u664,m42,ILSA,"Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
"
L118857,L118857,u664,m42,ILSA,"Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
"
L118856,L118856,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said ""no questions.""
"
L118855,L118855,u664,m42,ILSA,"That's easy. There was. He's dead.
"
L118854,L118854,u667,m42,RICK,"Uh huh.
"
L118853,L118853,u664,m42,ILSA,"Why there is no other man in my life?
"
L118852,L118852,u667,m42,RICK,"Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
"
L118851,L118851,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes?
"
L118850,L118850,u667,m42,RICK,"And I was wondering.
"
L118849,L118849,u664,m42,ILSA,"I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
"
L118848,L118848,u667,m42,RICK,"In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
"
L118847,L118847,u664,m42,ILSA,"A franc for your thoughts.
"
L118846,L118846,u667,m42,RICK,"Here's looking at you, kid.
"
L118845,L118845,u664,m42,ILSA,"We said ""no questions.""
"
L118844,L118844,u667,m42,RICK,"Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
"
L118799,L118799,u667,m42,RICK,"He hasn't played it in a long time.
"
L118798,L118798,u664,m42,ILSA,"There's still nobody in the world who can play ""As Time Goes By"" like Sam.
"
L118797,L118797,u667,m42,RICK,"I will.
"
L118796,L118796,u664,m42,ILSA,"Say goodnight to Sam for me.
"
L118785,L118785,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
"
L118784,L118784,u667,m42,RICK,"I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
"
L118783,L118783,u664,m42,ILSA,"No.
"
L118782,L118782,u667,m42,RICK,"Not an easy day to forget.
"
L118781,L118781,u664,m42,ILSA,"How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
"
L118780,L118780,u667,m42,RICK,"-- It was ""La Belle Aurore.""
"
L118751,L118751,u664,m42,ILSA,"Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By.""
"
L118749,L118749,u664,m42,ILSA,"Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
"
L118747,L118747,u664,m42,ILSA,"You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
"
L118745,L118745,u664,m42,ILSA,"Does he always leave so early?
"
L118743,L118743,u664,m42,ILSA,"When will he be back?
"
L118741,L118741,u664,m42,ILSA,"Where is Rick?
"
L118739,L118739,u664,m42,ILSA,"Some of the old songs, Sam.
"
L118737,L118737,u664,m42,ILSA,"It's been a long time.
"
L118735,L118735,u664,m42,ILSA,"Hello, Sam.
"
L119477,L119477,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
"
L119257,L119257,u664,m42,ILSA,"Be careful.
"
L119253,L119253,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
"
L119251,L119251,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Victor, there isn't.
"
L119249,L119249,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, Victor, I was.
"
L119247,L119247,u664,m42,ILSA,"-- Yes?
"
L119243,L119243,u664,m42,ILSA,"Ask me?
"
L119241,L119241,u664,m42,ILSA,"Did he give any reason?
"
L119239,L119239,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes?
"
L119237,L119237,u664,m42,ILSA,"Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
"
L119235,L119235,u664,m42,ILSA,"Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
"
L119233,L119233,u664,m42,ILSA,"Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
"
L119230,L119230,u664,m42,ILSA,"What happened with Rick?
"
L119147,L119147,u664,m42,ILSA,"He does. Could we have a table close to him?
"
L119026,L119026,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
"
L119024,L119024,u664,m42,ILSA,"But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
"
L119021,L119021,u664,m42,ILSA,"No, Victor, no.
"
L119019,L119019,u664,m42,ILSA,"We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
"
L118808,L118808,u664,m42,ILSA,"Goodnight.
"
L118800,L118800,u664,m42,ILSA,"Goodnight.
"
L118714,L118714,u664,m42,ILSA,"Be careful.
"
L118711,L118711,u664,m42,ILSA,"Victor, I'm afraid for you.
"
L118682,L118682,u664,m42,ILSA,"You are very kind.
"
L118660,L118660,u664,m42,ILSA,"Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
"
L119455,L119455,u664,m42,ILSA,"You're saying this only to make me go.
"
L118779,L118779,u664,m42,ILSA,"I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
"
L118763,L118763,u664,m42,ILSA,"-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
"
L118760,L118760,u664,m42,ILSA,"Hello, Rick.
"
L118694,L118694,u664,m42,ILSA,"-- Is what?
"
L118692,L118692,u664,m42,ILSA,"Rick? Who's he?
"
L118690,L118690,u664,m42,ILSA,"Yes.
"
L118688,L118688,u664,m42,ILSA,"Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
"
L119473,L119473,u667,m42,RICK,"Here it is.
"
L119469,L119469,u667,m42,RICK,"But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
"
L119467,L119467,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
"
L119465,L119465,u667,m42,RICK,"All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
"
L119416,L119416,u667,m42,RICK,"Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
"
L119414,L119414,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
"
L119412,L119412,u667,m42,RICK,"Keep it. You'll need it in America.
"
L119410,L119410,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
"
L119343,L119343,u667,m42,RICK,"You love her that much?
"
L119341,L119341,u667,m42,RICK,"You seem to know all about my destiny.
"
L119339,L119339,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I get the point.
"
L119337,L119337,u667,m42,RICK,"What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
"
L119335,L119335,u667,m42,RICK,"Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
"
L119333,L119333,u667,m42,RICK,"Had a close one, eh?
"
L119331,L119331,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, this might come in handy.
"
L119202,L119202,u667,m42,RICK,"I said, ask your wife.
"
L119200,L119200,u667,m42,RICK,"There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
"
L119198,L119198,u667,m42,RICK,"My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
"
L119196,L119196,u667,m42,RICK,"I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
"
L119194,L119194,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
"
L119192,L119192,u667,m42,RICK,"What of it?
"
L119190,L119190,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
"
L119187,L119187,u667,m42,RICK,"My office.
"
L119185,L119185,u667,m42,RICK,"Go ahead.
"
L119146,L119146,u667,m42,RICK,"I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
"
L119144,L119144,u667,m42,RICK,"Good evening.
"
L118987,L118987,u667,m42,RICK,"Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
"
L118795,L118795,u667,m42,RICK,"Any time.
"
L118790,L118790,u667,m42,RICK,"Not at all.
"
L118777,L118777,u667,m42,RICK,"We all try. You succeed.
"
L118775,L118775,u667,m42,RICK,"Your work.
"
L118773,L118773,u667,m42,RICK,"And I congratulate you.
"
L118767,L118767,u667,m42,RICK,"And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
"
L118765,L118765,u667,m42,RICK,"How do you do?
"
L119508,L119508,u667,m42,RICK,"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
"
L119506,L119506,u667,m42,RICK,"Our expenses?
"
L119504,L119504,u667,m42,RICK,"My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
"
L119501,L119501,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
"
L119484,L119484,u667,m42,RICK,"As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
"
L119482,L119482,u667,m42,RICK,"Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
"
L119480,L119480,u667,m42,RICK,"Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
"
L119445,L119445,u667,m42,RICK,"And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
"
L119443,L119443,u667,m42,RICK,"If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
"
L119432,L119432,u667,m42,RICK,"Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
"
L119430,L119430,u667,m42,RICK,"I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
"
L119424,L119424,u667,m42,RICK,"I have. Sit down over there.
"
L119422,L119422,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
"
L119398,L119398,u667,m42,RICK,"Sam's piano.
"
L119396,L119396,u667,m42,RICK,"I have the letters right here.
"
L119394,L119394,u667,m42,RICK,"Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
"
L119391,L119391,u667,m42,RICK,"I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
"
L119389,L119389,u667,m42,RICK,"You're late.
"
L119375,L119375,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, thanks.
"
L119373,L119373,u667,m42,RICK,"I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
"
L119371,L119371,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, she isn't just any woman.
"
L119369,L119369,u667,m42,RICK,"I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
"
L119368,L119368,u667,m42,RICK,"Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
"
L119366,L119366,u667,m42,RICK,"Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
"
L119362,L119362,u667,m42,RICK,"Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
"
L119360,L119360,u667,m42,RICK,"And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
"
L119358,L119358,u667,m42,RICK,"You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
"
L119356,L119356,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, they're all excellent reasons.
"
L119354,L119354,u667,m42,RICK,"-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
"
L119352,L119352,u667,m42,RICK,"But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
"
L119214,L119214,u667,m42,RICK,"How can you close me up? On what grounds?
"
L119182,L119182,u667,m42,RICK,"Put it down as a gesture to love.
"
L119180,L119180,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah? Why?
"
L119061,L119061,u667,m42,RICK,"So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
"
L119059,L119059,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, it looks like you're a little late.
"
L119057,L119057,u667,m42,RICK,"Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
"
L119055,L119055,u667,m42,RICK,"That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
"
L118792,L118792,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, it's my party.
"
L118770,L118770,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Thanks. I will.
"
L118759,L118759,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Hello, Ilsa.
"
L118625,L118625,u667,m42,RICK,"I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
"
L118614,L118614,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, how do you do?
"
L118578,L118578,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah, you were saying?
"
L118575,L118575,u667,m42,RICK,"Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
"
L118573,L118573,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
"
L118571,L118571,u667,m42,RICK,"And got well paid for it on both occasions.
"
L118568,L118568,u667,m42,RICK,"Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
"
L118566,L118566,u667,m42,RICK,"Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
"
L118564,L118564,u667,m42,RICK,"He'll take one.
"
L118562,L118562,u667,m42,RICK,"Why two?
"
L118560,L118560,u667,m42,RICK,"Okay.
"
L118558,L118558,u667,m42,RICK,"I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
"
L118556,L118556,u667,m42,RICK,"Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
"
L118554,L118554,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
"
L118552,L118552,u667,m42,RICK,"His escape.
"
L118550,L118550,u667,m42,RICK,"It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
"
L118548,L118548,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
"
L118546,L118546,u667,m42,RICK,"Victor Laszlo?
"
L118544,L118544,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah? What's his name?
"
L118542,L118542,u667,m42,RICK,"I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
"
L118540,L118540,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah? Have a brandy?
"
L118533,L118533,u667,m42,RICK,"I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
"
L118531,L118531,u667,m42,RICK,"Our entertainment is enough.
"
L118528,L118528,u667,m42,RICK,"I stick my neck out for nobody.
"
L118525,L118525,u667,m42,RICK,"What, again?
"
L118517,L118517,u667,m42,RICK,"I was misinformed.
"
L118515,L118515,u667,m42,RICK,"My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
"
L118513,L118513,u667,m42,RICK,"It was a combination of all three.
"
L118510,L118510,u667,m42,RICK,"Why? What's in Lisbon?
"
L118507,L118507,u667,m42,RICK,"When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
"
L118504,L118504,u667,m42,RICK,"Hello, Louis.
"
L118494,L118494,u667,m42,RICK,"Come on, we're going to get your coat.
"
L118492,L118492,u667,m42,RICK,"-- Sacha, call a cab.
"
L118488,L118488,u667,m42,RICK,"Sacha, she's had enough.
"
L118486,L118486,u667,m42,RICK,"I never make plans that far ahead.
"
L118484,L118484,u667,m42,RICK,"That's so long ago, I don't remember.
"
L119495,L119495,u667,m42,RICK,"Put it down!
"
L119493,L119493,u667,m42,RICK,"Put that phone down!
"
L119491,L119491,u667,m42,RICK,"I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
"
L118650,L118650,u667,m42,RICK,"You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
"
L118646,L118646,u667,m42,RICK,"Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
"
L118644,L118644,u667,m42,RICK,"My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
"
L118642,L118642,u667,m42,RICK,"Are my eyes really brown?
"
L118636,L118636,u667,m42,RICK,"I haven't the slightest idea.
"
L118634,L118634,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
"
L118629,L118629,u667,m42,RICK,"It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
"
L118627,L118627,u667,m42,RICK,"There seems to be no secret about that.
"
L118623,L118623,u667,m42,RICK,"I'm a drunkard.
"
L118621,L118621,u667,m42,RICK,"Make it official, if you like.
"
L118603,L118603,u667,m42,RICK,"Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
"
L118452,L118452,u667,m42,RICK,"I don't want them here overnight.
"
L118450,L118450,u667,m42,RICK,"For how long?
"
L118446,L118446,u667,m42,RICK,"Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
"
L118444,L118444,u667,m42,RICK,"I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
"
L118442,L118442,u667,m42,RICK,"For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
"
L118440,L118440,u667,m42,RICK,"If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
"
L118438,L118438,u667,m42,RICK,"No.
"
L118434,L118434,u667,m42,RICK,"They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
"
L118431,L118431,u667,m42,RICK,"-- You thought what?
"
L118429,L118429,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, what makes you think I haven't?
"
L118423,L118423,u667,m42,RICK,"Hello Ugarte.
"
L118889,L118889,u667,m42,RICK,"Where is she? Have you seen her?
"
L118872,L118872,u667,m42,RICK,"And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
"
L118863,L118863,u667,m42,RICK,"You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
"
L118842,L118842,u667,m42,RICK,"If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
"
L118840,L118840,u667,m42,RICK,"You played it for her and you can play it for me.
"
L118838,L118838,u667,m42,RICK,"Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
"
L118836,L118836,u667,m42,RICK,"What's that you're playing?
"
L118834,L118834,u667,m42,RICK,"I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
"
L118832,L118832,u667,m42,RICK,"Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
"
L118830,L118830,u667,m42,RICK,"They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
"
L118828,L118828,u667,m42,RICK,"Shut up and go home, will you?
"
L118826,L118826,u667,m42,RICK,"She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
"
L118824,L118824,u667,m42,RICK,"No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
"
L118822,L118822,u667,m42,RICK,"Then don't have a drink.
"
L118820,L118820,u667,m42,RICK,"Good. Then have a drink.
"
L118818,L118818,u667,m42,RICK,"No.
"
L118816,L118816,u667,m42,RICK,"No.
"
L118814,L118814,u667,m42,RICK,"Not right now.
"
L118812,L118812,u667,m42,RICK,"Yeah?
"
L118478,L118478,u667,m42,RICK,"Sorry.
"
L118476,L118476,u667,m42,RICK,"He'll double what I pay you.
"
L118474,L118474,u667,m42,RICK,"Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
"
L130952,L130952,u695,m44,HOMER,"I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
"
L130949,L130949,u695,m44,HOMER,"I doubt it. She's just an...
"
L130947,L130947,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know.
"
L130944,L130944,u695,m44,HOMER,"Better than I can!
"
L130942,L130942,u695,m44,HOMER,"You cook very well!
"
L130940,L130940,u695,m44,HOMER,"What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
"
L130938,L130938,u695,m44,HOMER,"Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
"
L130936,L130936,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
"
L130848,L130848,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm *not* a doctor!
"
L130846,L130846,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
"
L130844,L130844,u695,m44,HOMER,"He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
"
L130842,L130842,u695,m44,HOMER,"It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
"
L131746,L131746,u695,m44,HOMER,"No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
"
L131744,L131744,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
"
L131742,L131742,u695,m44,HOMER,"Sure. Thanks.
"
L131740,L131740,u695,m44,HOMER,"She knows how to take care of herself.
"
L131718,L131718,u695,m44,HOMER,"And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
"
L131716,L131716,u695,m44,HOMER,"""...did."" Well, okay.
"
L131714,L131714,u695,m44,HOMER,"I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
"
L131713,L131713,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
"
L131662,L131662,u695,m44,HOMER,"He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
"
L131660,L131660,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know, I'm sorry.
"
L131658,L131658,u695,m44,HOMER,"You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
"
L131656,L131656,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
"
L131654,L131654,u695,m44,HOMER,"*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
"
L131649,L131649,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know.  Is *that* nothing.
"
L131647,L131647,u695,m44,HOMER,"Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
"
L131645,L131645,u695,m44,HOMER,"Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
"
L131603,L131603,u695,m44,HOMER,"Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
"
L131601,L131601,u695,m44,HOMER,"Mr. Rose *knows*?
"
L131599,L131599,u695,m44,HOMER,"Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
"
L131578,L131578,u695,m44,HOMER,"I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
"
L131556,L131556,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
"
L131554,L131554,u695,m44,HOMER,"Fine. That's all there is to it then.
"
L131552,L131552,u695,m44,HOMER,"So we should ""wait and see."" For how long?
"
L131517,L131517,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
"
L131488,L131488,u695,m44,HOMER,"*What* will be okay?
"
L131486,L131486,u695,m44,HOMER,"Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
"
L131481,L131481,u695,m44,HOMER,"Right.
"
L131474,L131474,u695,m44,HOMER,"Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
"
L131456,L131456,u695,m44,HOMER,"That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
"
L131454,L131454,u695,m44,HOMER,"How could you not *care* about the movie?
"
L131451,L131451,u695,m44,HOMER,"Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
"
L131449,L131449,u695,m44,HOMER,"Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
"
L131446,L131446,u695,m44,HOMER,"I never *asked* for any responsibility.
"
L131444,L131444,u695,m44,HOMER,"I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
"
L131441,L131441,u695,m44,HOMER,"I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
"
L131439,L131439,u695,m44,HOMER,"It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
"
L131435,L131435,u695,m44,HOMER,"The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
"
L131434,L131434,u695,m44,HOMER,"You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
"
L131369,L131369,u695,m44,HOMER,"What's the *medical* explanation?
"
L131368,L131368,u695,m44,HOMER,"Oh, sure!
"
L131366,L131366,u695,m44,HOMER,"And what did she die of, exactly?
"
L131364,L131364,u695,m44,HOMER,"First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
"
L131363,L131363,u695,m44,HOMER,"I *did* like it. All I said was, ""It's not 'King Kong'.""
"
L131350,L131350,u695,m44,HOMER,"""King Kong"". It's really good.
"
L131348,L131348,u695,m44,HOMER,"Yes! I've only seen one, though.
"
L131346,L131346,u695,m44,HOMER,"People watched the movies in their cars?
"
L131344,L131344,u695,m44,HOMER,"A movie *outside*?
"
L131325,L131325,u695,m44,HOMER,"I better go.
"
L131324,L131324,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay...
"
L131321,L131321,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
"
L131320,L131320,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
"
L131171,L131171,u695,m44,HOMER,"Sure... I'll see you around.
"
L131155,L131155,u695,m44,HOMER,"It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
"
L131146,L131146,u695,m44,HOMER,"I understand.
"
L131144,L131144,u695,m44,HOMER,"Oh...
"
L131142,L131142,u695,m44,HOMER,"Where's Mandalay?
"
L131140,L131140,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know.
"
L131136,L131136,u695,m44,HOMER,"I've never seen the ocean, either.
"
L131134,L131134,u695,m44,HOMER,"I've never seen a lobster.
"
L131132,L131132,u695,m44,HOMER,"Is your family in the apple business, too?
"
L131047,L131047,u695,m44,HOMER,"How many months are you?
"
L131044,L131044,u695,m44,HOMER,"So, Mrs...
"
L131595,L131595,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
"
L131591,L131591,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I can't go nowhere.
"
L131586,L131586,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
"
L131584,L131584,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
"
L131582,L131582,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Hi...
"
L131542,L131542,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"How is that Wally doing?
"
L130919,L130919,u695,m44,HOMER,"Only the right people can have you, Curly.
"
L130917,L130917,u695,m44,HOMER,"Nobody special enough, Curly.
"
L130915,L130915,u695,m44,HOMER,"That's true.
"
L130913,L130913,u695,m44,HOMER,"You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
"
L130911,L130911,u695,m44,HOMER,"They wanted a girl.
"
L131082,L131082,u695,m44,HOMER,"Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
"
L131078,L131078,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh... it's the end of October.
"
L130976,L130976,u695,m44,HOMER,"""I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it.""
"
L130971,L130971,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
"
L130861,L130861,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
"
L130859,L130859,u695,m44,HOMER,"It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
"
L130857,L130857,u695,m44,HOMER,"Did you bite it?
"
L131262,L131262,u695,m44,HOMER,"Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
"
L131260,L131260,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
"
L131237,L131237,u695,m44,HOMER,"What about the trees?
"
L131188,L131188,u695,m44,HOMER,"Migrants?
"
L131169,L131169,u695,m44,HOMER,"Oh, I would love that, Wally.
"
L131164,L131164,u695,m44,HOMER,"What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
"
L131162,L131162,u695,m44,HOMER,"At what altitude?
"
L131160,L131160,u695,m44,HOMER,"""Burma run"" because you fly over Burma...
"
L131152,L131152,u695,m44,HOMER,"It's all very normal.
"
L131150,L131150,u695,m44,HOMER,"This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
"
L131128,L131128,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, I'm not. I need a job.
"
L131126,L131126,u695,m44,HOMER,"I think I'd probably like the apple business.
"
L131088,L131088,u695,m44,HOMER,"Where are you going?
"
L131086,L131086,u695,m44,HOMER,"I wonder if you might give me a ride.
"
L131084,L131084,u695,m44,HOMER,"Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
"
L131066,L131066,u695,m44,HOMER,"No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
"
L131064,L131064,u695,m44,HOMER,"They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
"
L131062,L131062,u695,m44,HOMER,"Liberator...
"
L131060,L131060,u695,m44,HOMER,"What kind of plane are you flying?
"
L131050,L131050,u695,m44,HOMER,"No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
"
L131038,L131038,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
"
L131736,L131736,u695,m44,HOMER,"Right?
"
L131732,L131732,u695,m44,HOMER,"There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
"
L131726,L131726,u695,m44,HOMER,"Where'd she get you?
"
L131684,L131684,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay. Then you can be of use.
"
L131679,L131679,u695,m44,HOMER,"Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
"
L131677,L131677,u695,m44,HOMER,"One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
"
L131675,L131675,u695,m44,HOMER,"Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
"
L131672,L131672,u695,m44,HOMER,"Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
"
L131615,L131615,u695,m44,HOMER,"But she's your *daughter*...
"
L131613,L131613,u695,m44,HOMER,"Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
"
L131611,L131611,u695,m44,HOMER,"You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
"
L131609,L131609,u695,m44,HOMER,"You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
"
L131606,L131606,u695,m44,HOMER,"Is it true?
"
L131483,L131483,u695,m44,HOMER,"This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
"
L131411,L131411,u695,m44,HOMER,"What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
"
L131300,L131300,u695,m44,HOMER,"Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
"
L131267,L131267,u695,m44,HOMER,"I guess so...
"
L131233,L131233,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay...
"
L131216,L131216,u695,m44,HOMER,"Right.
"
L131201,L131201,u695,m44,HOMER,"So. What should I do now?
"
L131530,L131530,u695,m44,HOMER,"I am not a doctor.
"
L131099,L131099,u695,m44,HOMER,"I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
"
L131097,L131097,u695,m44,HOMER,"You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
"
L131095,L131095,u695,m44,HOMER,"Of course.
"
L131093,L131093,u695,m44,HOMER,"I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
"
L131022,L131022,u695,m44,HOMER,"Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
"
L131020,L131020,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm happy I amuse you.
"
L131015,L131015,u695,m44,HOMER,"How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
"
L130973,L130973,u695,m44,HOMER,"I thought it was my turn.
"
L130962,L130962,u695,m44,HOMER,"It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
"
L130895,L130895,u695,m44,HOMER,"Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
"
L130893,L130893,u695,m44,HOMER,"Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
"
L130891,L130891,u695,m44,HOMER,"I don't think so.
"
L130889,L130889,u695,m44,HOMER,"He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
"
L130886,L130886,u695,m44,HOMER,"Nobody's named this one yet.
"
L130853,L130853,u695,m44,HOMER,"But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
"
L130851,L130851,u695,m44,HOMER,"I haven't read that.
"
L130837,L130837,u695,m44,HOMER,"In other words, scurvy.
"
L130835,L130835,u695,m44,HOMER,"I don't know it.
"
L130832,L130832,u695,m44,HOMER,"It's obviously an aborticide.
"
L130824,L130824,u695,m44,HOMER,"It looks like scurvy.
"
L130822,L130822,u695,m44,HOMER,"There was no visible wound?
"
L130801,L130801,u695,m44,HOMER,"One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
"
L130799,L130799,u695,m44,HOMER,"All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
"
L130797,L130797,u695,m44,HOMER,"Yes, for both.
"
L131507,L131507,u695,m44,HOMER,"Right.
"
L131502,L131502,u695,m44,HOMER,"Uh... sure.
"
L131500,L131500,u695,m44,HOMER,"I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
"
L131498,L131498,u695,m44,HOMER,"Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
"
L131760,L131760,u695,m44,HOMER,"Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
"
L131697,L131697,u695,m44,HOMER,"""Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch.""
"
L131695,L131695,u695,m44,HOMER,"""One: Please don't smoke in bed.""
"
L131619,L131619,u695,m44,HOMER,"How long's this been going on, Muddy?
"
L131708,L131708,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
"
L131707,L131707,u695,m44,HOMER,"That's it.
"
L131706,L131706,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"That's *it*?
"
L131575,L131575,u695,m44,HOMER,"Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
"
L131574,L131574,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
"
L131573,L131573,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
"
L131572,L131572,u695,m44,HOMER,"What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
"
L131571,L131571,u695,m44,HOMER,"Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
"
L131570,L131570,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
"
L131569,L131569,u695,m44,HOMER,"But you don't look very happy.
"
L131568,L131568,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
"
L131567,L131567,u695,m44,HOMER,"I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
"
L131566,L131566,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Not yet. What do you know about it?
"
L131565,L131565,u695,m44,HOMER,"You're not yet three months, are you?
"
L131563,L131563,u695,m44,HOMER,"I don't like watching anyone be sick.
"
L131562,L131562,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
"
L131561,L131561,u695,m44,HOMER,"You okay, Rose?
"
L131427,L131427,u695,m44,HOMER,"Almost.
"
L131426,L131426,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
"
L131425,L131425,u695,m44,HOMER,"Give men that. I know how to do it.
"
L131382,L131382,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
"
L131381,L131381,u695,m44,HOMER,"I'm not in trouble.
"
L131375,L131375,u695,m44,HOMER,"No trouble.
"
L131374,L131374,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
"
L131221,L131221,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I can't read. Nobody taught me.
"
L131220,L131220,u695,m44,HOMER,"Do you like to read?
"
L131214,L131214,u695,m44,HOMER,"Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
"
L131213,L131213,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"So what?
"
L131212,L131212,u695,m44,HOMER,"There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
"
L131211,L131211,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"What you got a picture of your heart for?
"
L131210,L131210,u695,m44,HOMER,"It's just my heart.
"

"
L131193,L131193,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
"
L131192,L131192,u695,m44,HOMER,"Rose Rose?
"
L131671,L131671,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
"
L131668,L131668,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
"
L131666,L131666,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
"
L131514,L131514,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
"
L131431,L131431,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
"
L131429,L131429,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
"
L131379,L131379,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
"
L131308,L131308,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"What's lucky about that?
"
L131306,L131306,u706,m44,ROSE ROSE,"Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
"
L430969,L430969,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
"
L430082,L430082,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
"
L430078,L430078,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I-- I must've misplaced it.
"
L430233,L430233,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So.  How do we get to Rome?
"
L430218,L430218,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Because.
"
L430216,L430216,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
"
L430171,L430171,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
"
L430166,L430166,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
"
L430164,L430164,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Excuse me?
"
L430158,L430158,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You ask what room he's in, okay?
"
L430398,L430398,u6937,m464,DAMON,"Did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
"
L430396,L430396,u6937,m464,DAMON,"Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
"
L430394,L430394,u6937,m464,DAMON,"Were they pen pals?
"
L430391,L430391,u6937,m464,DAMON,"Seriously.
"
L430389,L430389,u6937,m464,DAMON,"No, really.  What's she doing?
"
L430387,L430387,u6937,m464,DAMON,"What for?
"
L430385,L430385,u6937,m464,DAMON,"What's she doing?
"
L430383,L430383,u6937,m464,DAMON,"So, what's the story with your friend?
"
L430474,L430474,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What is it?
"
L430472,L430472,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430470,L430470,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It's alright...  this is our destiny.
"
L430468,L430468,u6940,m464,FAITH,"We found each other, didn't we?
"
L430466,L430466,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
"
L430463,L430463,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Let's find a telephone.
"
L430461,L430461,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
"
L430459,L430459,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
"
L430450,L430450,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
"
L430424,L430424,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
"
L430418,L430418,u6940,m464,FAITH,"My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
"
L430416,L430416,u6940,m464,FAITH,"--separate, in the evening...""
"
L430457,L430457,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
"
L430455,L430455,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
"
L430453,L430453,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
"
L430451,L430451,u6940,m464,FAITH,"There is one other thing you should know about me.
"
L430429,L430429,u6940,m464,FAITH,"My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
"
L430427,L430427,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'm a liberal!
"
L430422,L430422,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.
"
L430420,L430420,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
"
L430321,L430321,u6940,m464,FAITH,"That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
"
L430319,L430319,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What's mezzaluna?
"
L430312,L430312,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
"
L430309,L430309,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Ask her if she knows where he is?
"
L430952,L430952,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?...
"
L430950,L430950,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
"
L430949,L430949,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
"
L430947,L430947,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
"
L430945,L430945,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
"
L430934,L430934,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
"
L429873,L429873,u6940,m464,FAITH,"We'll KNOW.
"
L429871,L429871,u6940,m464,FAITH,"If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
"
L429869,L429869,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
"
L429864,L429864,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Wait.  I have to write this down.
"
L430919,L430919,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Hm.
"
L430917,L430917,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Non.  Please.
"
L430915,L430915,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Amazing.
"
L430909,L430909,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
"
L430907,L430907,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Congratulations.
"
L430905,L430905,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
"
L430903,L430903,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
"
L430901,L430901,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You...
"
L430067,L430067,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
"
L430065,L430065,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Where are you going?
"
L430063,L430063,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
"
L430061,L430061,u6940,m464,FAITH,"WAIT!!  Where are you?
"
L430059,L430059,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Damon Bradley...
"
L430058,L430058,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
"
L430056,L430056,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
"
L430054,L430054,u6940,m464,FAITH,"This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
"
L430052,L430052,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
"
L430050,L430050,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Hello?  Is anybody there?
"
L430982,L430982,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I brought you that, too.
"
L430896,L430896,u6940,m464,FAITH,"There is no us.
"
L430893,L430893,u6940,m464,FAITH,"That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
"
L430891,L430891,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes.
"
L430889,L430889,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
"
L430887,L430887,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
"
L430885,L430885,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
"
L430883,L430883,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I would call it-- unforgivable.
"
L430881,L430881,u6940,m464,FAITH,"A ""little white lie""?  A ""little white lie""?
"
L430879,L430879,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
"
L430877,L430877,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
"
L430875,L430875,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I can't believe you did that!
"
L430872,L430872,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
"
L430870,L430870,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
"
L430868,L430868,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430866,L430866,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
"
L430864,L430864,u6940,m464,FAITH,"GET OUT!!
"
L430860,L430860,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
"
L430854,L430854,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes.  I am.
"
L430852,L430852,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
"
L430850,L430850,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
"
L430848,L430848,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
"
L430846,L430846,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
"
L430845,L430845,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  I just came by to apologize.
"
L430843,L430843,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Hi.  Are you... busy?
"
L430814,L430814,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  Course not.
"
L430810,L430810,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
"
L430806,L430806,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
"
L430803,L430803,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah.
"
L430781,L430781,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
"
L430779,L430779,u6940,m464,FAITH,"How about music?  You like classical?
"
L430776,L430776,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
"
L430755,L430755,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So were you.
"
L430753,L430753,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why are you doing this?
"
L430751,L430751,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know if that's such a--
"
L430742,L430742,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You were saying...
"
L430727,L430727,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What are you doing here?
"
L430707,L430707,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
"
L430705,L430705,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430703,L430703,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You too.
"
L430701,L430701,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
"
L430697,L430697,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, good.  Good for you.
"
L430694,L430694,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh.  That's nice.
"
L430692,L430692,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
"
L430688,L430688,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Hi, Peter.
"
L430632,L430632,u6940,m464,FAITH,"NO.
"
L430625,L430625,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Right now?
"
L430619,L430619,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Mickey Spillane?
"
L430617,L430617,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Please.  I need to know.
"
L430615,L430615,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Tell me.
"
L430613,L430613,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
"
L430604,L430604,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why?
"
L430602,L430602,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
"
L430600,L430600,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Where's Positano?
"
L430597,L430597,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why not?
"
L430594,L430594,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Who says I don't love him?...
"
L430590,L430590,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
"
L430589,L430589,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
"
L430587,L430587,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So it wasn't real.
"
L430585,L430585,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
"
L430582,L430582,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430579,L430579,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why are you asking me this?
"
L430577,L430577,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
"
L430575,L430575,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
"
L430573,L430573,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
"
L430571,L430571,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes.
"
L430569,L430569,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes.
"
L430567,L430567,u6940,m464,FAITH,"If it's any of your business, yes.
"
L430564,L430564,u6940,m464,FAITH,"NO.
"
L430562,L430562,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
"
L430489,L430489,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
"
L430487,L430487,u6940,m464,FAITH,"How could you do this to me?
"
L430483,L430483,u6940,m464,FAITH,"That was before I found out what it was.
"
L430481,L430481,u6940,m464,FAITH,"That's not the point.
"
L430790,L430790,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430738,L430738,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, you say you've been to Italy before?
"
L430734,L430734,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, hello.
"
L430730,L430730,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
"
L430725,L430725,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
"
L430723,L430723,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What looks good?
"
L430722,L430722,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
"
L430720,L430720,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Excuse me?
"
L430715,L430715,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, to-- new friends.
"
L430713,L430713,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Really?
"
L430710,L430710,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Sure.
"
L430680,L430680,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
"
L430678,L430678,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes?
"
L430676,L430676,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
"
L430673,L430673,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You would?  Really?
"
L430671,L430671,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
"
L430669,L430669,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Any night.
"
L430667,L430667,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
"
L430664,L430664,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
"
L430662,L430662,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Been here long?
"
L430660,L430660,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Beautiful place...
"
L430646,L430646,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You're Damon Bradley?
"
L430941,L430941,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Larry, did you rent a car?
"
L430939,L430939,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
"
L430840,L430840,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
"
L430838,L430838,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And Larry?...
"
L430835,L430835,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
"
L430833,L430833,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I didn't expect you back so soon.
"
L430831,L430831,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Kate is that you?
"
L430816,L430816,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
"
L430796,L430796,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
"
L430794,L430794,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
"
L430792,L430792,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He's a jerk.
"
L430774,L430774,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
"
L430772,L430772,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Maybe I can change him.
"
L430769,L430769,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
"
L430767,L430767,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No one's perfect, Kate.
"
L430761,L430761,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
"
L430652,L430652,u6940,m464,FAITH,"My God... you're right.
"
L430650,L430650,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What if he doesn't like me?
"
L430622,L430622,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Is Damon Bradley here?
"
L430610,L430610,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
"
L430608,L430608,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
"
L430553,L430553,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
"
L430551,L430551,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  No, you go ahead.
"
L430547,L430547,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430545,L430545,u6940,m464,FAITH,"The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
"
L430544,L430544,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
"
L430542,L430542,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
"
L430540,L430540,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It was a ouija board, remember?
"
L430538,L430538,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
"
L430536,L430536,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
"
L430534,L430534,u6940,m464,FAITH,"A little bad luck?
"
L430532,L430532,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
"
L430530,L430530,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Packing.
"
L430528,L430528,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Hi.  Where've you been?
"
L430491,L430491,u6940,m464,FAITH,"But how could he know?  He only just met me.
"
L430379,L430379,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
"
L430377,L430377,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Like a detective.
"
L430375,L430375,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I meant about my idea.
"
L430368,L430368,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
"
L430366,L430366,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
"
L430362,L430362,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430360,L430360,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
"
L430358,L430358,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
"
L430353,L430353,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Is he looking at us?
"
L430351,L430351,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh my God.  Where?
"
L430349,L430349,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
"
L430347,L430347,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Sure you did.
"
L430345,L430345,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Because I'm the one who's single.
"
L430343,L430343,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
"
L430334,L430334,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
"
L430330,L430330,u6940,m464,FAITH,"All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
"
L430300,L430300,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
"
L430292,L430292,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Right.  My brother.
"
L430290,L430290,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
"
L430261,L430261,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Larry bought himself cologne?
"
L430258,L430258,u6940,m464,FAITH,"And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
"
L430253,L430253,u6940,m464,FAITH,"'Course he does.
"
L430251,L430251,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
"
L430249,L430249,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Sorry.
"
L430247,L430247,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You expecting somebody you know?
"
L430244,L430244,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Nothing.
"
L430242,L430242,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
"
L430239,L430239,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
"
L430237,L430237,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
"
L430235,L430235,u6940,m464,FAITH,"The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
"
L430227,L430227,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
"
L430214,L430214,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Only, it's in Italian...
"
L430212,L430212,u6940,m464,FAITH,"A phone message.  Only--
"
L430210,L430210,u6940,m464,FAITH,"We're saved!
"
L430208,L430208,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh.  Right.
"
L430206,L430206,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
"
L430204,L430204,u6940,m464,FAITH,"A Butterfinger wrapper.
"
L430202,L430202,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Ah ha!...
"
L430199,L430199,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
"
L430197,L430197,u6940,m464,FAITH,"The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
"
L430193,L430193,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
"
L430187,L430187,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He fell out.
"
L430182,L430182,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
"
L430180,L430180,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
"
L430178,L430178,u6940,m464,FAITH,"We lost him?...
"
L430176,L430176,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
"
L430153,L430153,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
"
L430151,L430151,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Are you sure?
"
L430149,L430149,u6940,m464,FAITH,"What?
"
L430142,L430142,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
"
L430140,L430140,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It's called... the Gritty Palace.
"
L430138,L430138,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Now what do we do?
"
L430132,L430132,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
"
L430127,L430127,u6940,m464,FAITH,"You're coming with me?
"
L430122,L430122,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Maybe.
"
L430120,L430120,u6940,m464,FAITH,"How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
"
L430117,L430117,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying. 
"
L430115,L430115,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Thank you so much.
"
L430113,L430113,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
"
L430110,L430110,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
"
L430102,L430102,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
"
L430100,L430100,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
"
L430098,L430098,u6940,m464,FAITH,"That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
"
L430096,L430096,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I have vacation time coming to me.
"
L430094,L430094,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It's still the new year...
"
L430092,L430092,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
"
L430072,L430072,u6940,m464,FAITH,"The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
"
L430070,L430070,u6940,m464,FAITH,"It's a miracle.
"
L430047,L430047,u6940,m464,FAITH,"After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
"
L430045,L430045,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Have you seen him with someone?
"
L430042,L430042,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Is that bad?...
"
L430040,L430040,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Kate, is something the matter?
"
L430038,L430038,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
"
L430036,L430036,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I know.  You're right.
"
L430034,L430034,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
"
L430031,L430031,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
"
L430029,L430029,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I know...  It was.
"
L430027,L430027,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
"
L430014,L430014,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yes you did.
"
L429979,L429979,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
"
L429977,L429977,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  He's never asked me.
"
L429973,L429973,u6940,m464,FAITH,"He's a podiatrist or something.
"
L429971,L429971,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know, Kate.
"
L429969,L429969,u6940,m464,FAITH,"So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
"
L429967,L429967,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't know.  I don't think so.
"
L429965,L429965,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.
"
L429963,L429963,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.
"
L429955,L429955,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I wish you didn't have to go so early.
"
L429953,L429953,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
"
L429951,L429951,u6940,m464,FAITH,"But somebody wrote those songs.
"
L429949,L429949,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Is everything okay?
"
L429941,L429941,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
"
L429939,L429939,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't have an Amana freezer.
"
L429937,L429937,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
"
L429934,L429934,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Scientologist.
"
L429932,L429932,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Just moved in with his girlfriend.
"
L429930,L429930,u6940,m464,FAITH,"No.  He smokes.
"
L429927,L429927,u6940,m464,FAITH,"I don't believe in statistics.
"
L429892,L429892,u6940,m464,FAITH,"Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
"
L194856,L194856,u861,m55,JOEL,"No one.
"
L194853,L194853,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, you told me that later.
"
L194851,L194851,u861,m55,JOEL,"I remember.
"
L194849,L194849,u861,m55,JOEL,"I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
"
L194847,L194847,u861,m55,JOEL,"Just a little overworked, maybe.
"
L194825,L194825,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194823,L194823,u861,m55,JOEL,"Thanks, guys.
"
L194402,L194402,u861,m55,JOEL,"They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
"
L194398,L194398,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
"
L194394,L194394,u861,m55,JOEL,"She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
"
L194884,L194884,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
"
L194873,L194873,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You did? You liked me?
"
L194871,L194871,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
"
L194425,L194425,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
"
L194078,L194078,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Okay, I guess.
"
L194076,L194076,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hi.
"
L194052,L194052,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
"
L194636,L194636,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What's wrong with me?
"
L194574,L194574,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
"
L194571,L194571,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm so excited. Yay!
"
L194555,L194555,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
"
L194553,L194553,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
"
L194551,L194551,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Come up to Boston with me?
"
L194550,L194550,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
"
L194548,L194548,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
"
L194333,L194333,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"In the room?
"
L194328,L194328,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You rat.
"
L194326,L194326,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Come over after I'm done here?
"
L194324,L194324,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You were not.
"
L194088,L194088,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
"
L194087,L194087,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
"
L194085,L194085,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
"
L194082,L194082,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Okay, I guess.
"
L195101,L195101,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
"
L195100,L195100,u861,m55,JOEL,"What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
"
L195099,L195099,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
"
L195098,L195098,u861,m55,JOEL,"I can't stop thinking about you.
"
L195097,L195097,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my ""gratuitous need to shock.""
"
L195072,L195072,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
"
L195071,L195071,u861,m55,JOEL,"I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
"
L195070,L195070,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
"
L195069,L195069,u861,m55,JOEL,"Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
"
L195068,L195068,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Doesn't sound like me.
"
L195067,L195067,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know.
"
L195066,L195066,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Did I use the term ""sexual conquests"" or is that your way of putting it.
"
L195065,L195065,u861,m55,JOEL,"Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
"
L195064,L195064,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
"
L195063,L195063,u861,m55,JOEL,"That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
"
L195062,L195062,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"A bully? Moi?
"
L195061,L195061,u861,m55,JOEL,"Says you were a bully...
"
L195060,L195060,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
"
L195045,L195045,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
"
L195044,L195044,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, you obviously don't know me.
"
L195043,L195043,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
"
L195042,L195042,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm nervous, too.
"
L195041,L195041,u861,m55,JOEL,"-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
"
L195040,L195040,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hey, Joel --
"
L195039,L195039,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
"
L195038,L195038,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"That's okay. I --
"
L195037,L195037,u861,m55,JOEL,"Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
"
L195036,L195036,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh, um...
"
L195035,L195035,u861,m55,JOEL,"Have sex. Y'know --
"
L195034,L195034,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Make love?
"
L195033,L195033,u861,m55,JOEL,"Listen, did you want to make love?
"
L195032,L195032,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, come here. Please.
"
L195031,L195031,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think I should go back.
"
L195030,L195030,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What if?
"
L195029,L195029,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know. What if it breaks?
"
L195026,L195026,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know.
"
L195025,L195025,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
"
L195000,L195000,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194999,L194999,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
"
L194998,L194998,u861,m55,JOEL,"Tomorrow?
"
L194997,L194997,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"When?
"
L194996,L194996,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194995,L194995,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So you'll call me, right?
"
L194947,L194947,u861,m55,JOEL,"I love you.
"
L194946,L194946,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Bye, Joel.
"
L194945,L194945,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
"
L194944,L194944,u861,m55,JOEL,"I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
"
L194943,L194943,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What if you stay this time?
"
L194942,L194942,u861,m55,JOEL,"I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, ""so go"" with such disdain.
"
L194941,L194941,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So go.
"
L194938,L194938,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
"
L194937,L194937,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think we should go.
"
L194936,L194936,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
"
L194935,L194935,u861,m55,JOEL,"Naomi.
"
L194934,L194934,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
"
L194933,L194933,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's dark.
"
L194932,L194932,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
"
L194931,L194931,u861,m55,JOEL,"I knew.
"
L194929,L194929,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
"
L194928,L194928,u861,m55,JOEL,"I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
"
L194927,L194927,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
"
L194924,L194924,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's freezing out here.
"
L194923,L194923,u861,m55,JOEL,"What are you doing?
"
L194922,L194922,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Cool.
"
L194921,L194921,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
"
L194920,L194920,u861,m55,JOEL,"Female.
"
L194919,L194919,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Male or female?
"
L194918,L194918,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh.
"
L194917,L194917,u861,m55,JOEL,"I do sort of live with somebody though.
"
L194916,L194916,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Let's move into this neighborhood.
"
L194915,L194915,u861,m55,JOEL,"Um, no.
"
L194914,L194914,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I wish we did. You married?
"
L194913,L194913,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
"
L194912,L194912,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, yeah. It goes ""Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines""?
"
L194911,L194911,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Do you know her poem that starts ""Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
"
L194910,L194910,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, maybe.
"
L194909,L194909,u861,m55,JOEL,"Seems too coincidental that way.
"
L194908,L194908,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I think, before.
"
L194907,L194907,u861,m55,JOEL,"Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
"
L194906,L194906,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me too. There's this poem --
"
L194905,L194905,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think she's great.
"
L194904,L194904,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
"
L194903,L194903,u861,m55,JOEL,"I love her.
"
L194902,L194902,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
"
L194901,L194901,u861,m55,JOEL,"Okay.
"
L194900,L194900,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
"
L194899,L194899,u861,m55,JOEL,"yeah?
"
L194898,L194898,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
"
L194897,L194897,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't think I've slept in a year.
"
L194896,L194896,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But my sleeping is really fucked up.
"
L194895,L194895,u861,m55,JOEL,"I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
"
L194894,L194894,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
"
L194891,L194891,u861,m55,JOEL,"Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
"
L194890,L194890,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What do we do?
"
L194889,L194889,u861,m55,JOEL,"I know.
"
L194888,L194888,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
"
L194887,L194887,u861,m55,JOEL,"Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
"
L194886,L194886,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, like that.
"
L194885,L194885,u861,m55,JOEL,"You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
"
L194882,L194882,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm Joel.
"
L194881,L194881,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh God, how horrid.
"
L194878,L194878,u861,m55,JOEL,"And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
"
L194877,L194877,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
"
L194876,L194876,u861,m55,JOEL,"You said --
"
L194875,L194875,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
"
L194874,L194874,u861,m55,JOEL,"You know what I did.
"
L194869,L194869,u861,m55,JOEL,"Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
"
L194868,L194868,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
"
L194867,L194867,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
"
L194866,L194866,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
"
L194865,L194865,u861,m55,JOEL,"You said...
"
L194863,L194863,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi.
"
L194862,L194862,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hi there.
"
L194822,L194822,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
"
L194821,L194821,u861,m55,JOEL,"It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
"
L194820,L194820,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I know.
"
L194819,L194819,u861,m55,JOEL,"I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
"
L194818,L194818,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Probably.
"
L194817,L194817,u861,m55,JOEL,"You had the whole human race pegged.
"
L194816,L194816,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I had you pegged, didn't I?
"
L194815,L194815,u861,m55,JOEL,"I remember that speech really well.
"
L194814,L194814,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
"
L194812,L194812,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
"
L194811,L194811,u861,m55,JOEL,"Okay.
"
L194810,L194810,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
"
L194809,L194809,u861,m55,JOEL,"Not yet. Not married.
"
L194808,L194808,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, you're married.
"
L194807,L194807,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'd like to... take you out or something.
"
L194806,L194806,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah?
"
L194805,L194805,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
"
L194804,L194804,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
"
L194788,L194788,u861,m55,JOEL,"I did it. I guess that means something.
"
L194787,L194787,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Is that what you want?
"
L194786,L194786,u861,m55,JOEL,"I told her today I need to end it.
"
L194768,L194768,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
"
L194767,L194767,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's very late.
"
L194766,L194766,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Come up and see me... now.
"
L194765,L194765,u861,m55,JOEL,"I dropped you off after. You said --
"
L194764,L194764,u861,m55,JOEL,"And I didn't have an argument.
"
L194763,L194763,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So what. Infatuation is good, too.
"
L194762,L194762,u861,m55,JOEL,"I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
"
L194761,L194761,u861,m55,JOEL,"I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
"
L194760,L194760,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But you weren't. I could tell.
"
L194759,L194759,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm sure, I said.
"
L194758,L194758,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
"
L194757,L194757,u861,m55,JOEL,"We did talk about Naomi.
"
L194756,L194756,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'll buy that. Black's always good.
"
L194755,L194755,u861,m55,JOEL,"Right. Something black though.
"
L194753,L194753,u861,m55,JOEL,"No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
"
L194752,L194752,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Egad, were you horrified?
"
L194751,L194751,u861,m55,JOEL,"God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
"
L194750,L194750,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What was I wearing?
"
L194749,L194749,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194748,L194748,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Naomi, I guess.
"
L194747,L194747,u861,m55,JOEL,"Do you remember what we talked about?
"
L194746,L194746,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"This is our first ""date"" date.
"
L194745,L194745,u861,m55,JOEL,"I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
"
L194744,L194744,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah.
"
L194743,L194743,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
"
L194688,L194688,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I love it!
"
L194687,L194687,u861,m55,JOEL,"I scoured the city for it.
"
L194685,L194685,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
"
L194684,L194684,u861,m55,JOEL,"Happy Birthday.
"
L194682,L194682,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
"
L194681,L194681,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel!
"
L194668,L194668,u861,m55,JOEL,"This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
"
L194667,L194667,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
"
L194663,L194663,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
"
L194662,L194662,u861,m55,JOEL,"They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
"
L194661,L194661,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
"
L194660,L194660,u861,m55,JOEL,"Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
"
L194659,L194659,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
"
L194635,L194635,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
"
L194634,L194634,u861,m55,JOEL,"He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
"
L194633,L194633,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Really? Is he cute?
"
L194632,L194632,u861,m55,JOEL,"There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
"
L194631,L194631,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What?
"
L194630,L194630,u861,m55,JOEL,"There's this guy!
"
L194629,L194629,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
"
L194628,L194628,u861,m55,JOEL,"I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
"
L194627,L194627,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You remember what happened next?
"
L194626,L194626,u861,m55,JOEL,"I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
"
L194625,L194625,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
"
L194593,L194593,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
"
L194592,L194592,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
"
L194591,L194591,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm right here.
"
L194590,L194590,u861,m55,JOEL,"I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
"
L194586,L194586,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
"
L194585,L194585,u861,m55,JOEL,"What do you mean?
"
L194584,L194584,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What if you hide me?
"
L194580,L194580,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know.
"
L194579,L194579,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
"
L194578,L194578,u861,m55,JOEL,"I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
"
L194577,L194577,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh?
"
L194576,L194576,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
"
L194575,L194575,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Such a beautiful view.
"
L194539,L194539,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, ""It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.""
"
L194538,L194538,u861,m55,JOEL,"No.
"
L194537,L194537,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
"
L194536,L194536,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, Tangerine?
"
L194535,L194535,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joely...
"
L194525,L194525,u861,m55,JOEL,"No. Thanks.
"
L194524,L194524,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"More?
"
L194520,L194520,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, you're a liar.
"
L194519,L194519,u861,m55,JOEL,"I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
"
L194518,L194518,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I want to know you.
"
L194517,L194517,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, it isn't that.
"
L194516,L194516,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
"
L194483,L194483,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
"
L194482,L194482,u861,m55,JOEL,"You're drunk.
"
L194477,L194477,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Would you get me another, Joely?
"
L194476,L194476,u861,m55,JOEL,"So, um --
"
L194472,L194472,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
"
L194471,L194471,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh, thank God. It's going.
"
L194470,L194470,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
"
L194469,L194469,u861,m55,JOEL,"Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
"
L194468,L194468,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
"
L194467,L194467,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
"
L194466,L194466,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't want to talk about this here.
"
L194465,L194465,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What?!
"
L194464,L194464,u861,m55,JOEL,"Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
"
L194463,L194463,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're not ready.
"
L194462,L194462,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't think we're ready.
"
L194461,L194461,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
"
L194460,L194460,u861,m55,JOEL,"Let's talk about it later.
"
L194459,L194459,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I want to have a baby.
"
L194458,L194458,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
"
L194457,L194457,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
"
L194456,L194456,u861,m55,JOEL,"Where are you going?
"
L194455,L194455,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"How can you watch this crap?
"
L194438,L194438,u861,m55,JOEL,"Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
"
L194437,L194437,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
"
L194436,L194436,u861,m55,JOEL,"Let me drive you home.
"
L194434,L194434,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
"
L194433,L194433,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
"
L194430,L194430,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
"
L194429,L194429,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
"
L194428,L194428,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
"
L194427,L194427,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
"
L194426,L194426,u861,m55,JOEL,"I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
"
L194423,L194423,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's three.
"
L194422,L194422,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yo ho ho!
"
L194331,L194331,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You didn't say anything about my hair.
"
L194330,L194330,u861,m55,JOEL,"How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
"
L194299,L194299,u861,m55,JOEL,"Okay.
"
L194298,L194298,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
"
L194297,L194297,u861,m55,JOEL,"Tomorrow?
"
L194296,L194296,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"When?
"
L194295,L194295,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194294,L194294,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You'll call me, right?
"
L194293,L194293,u861,m55,JOEL,"So, I enjoyed meeting you.
"
L194291,L194291,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yes.
"
L194290,L194290,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
"
L194289,L194289,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Okay.
"
L194288,L194288,u861,m55,JOEL,"I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
"
L194287,L194287,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You should stay.
"
L194286,L194286,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sounds good. But right now I should go.
"
L194285,L194285,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
"
L194284,L194284,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah? Oh, great!
"
L194283,L194283,u861,m55,JOEL,"Okay.
"
L194282,L194282,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
"
L194281,L194281,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think so.
"
L194280,L194280,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
"
L194279,L194279,u861,m55,JOEL,"That's scary sounding.
"
L194278,L194278,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
"
L194277,L194277,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh, yeah.
"
L194276,L194276,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
"
L194275,L194275,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
"
L194274,L194274,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, not at all.
"
L194273,L194273,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
"
L194272,L194272,u861,m55,JOEL,"No.
"
L194271,L194271,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
"
L194270,L194270,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194269,L194269,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
"
L194268,L194268,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
"
L194267,L194267,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
"
L194266,L194266,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194265,L194265,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
"
L194264,L194264,u861,m55,JOEL,"Thanks.
"
L194263,L194263,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
"
L194262,L194262,u861,m55,JOEL,"I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
"
L194261,L194261,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
"
L194260,L194260,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think about that.
"
L194259,L194259,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
"
L194258,L194258,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
"
L194257,L194257,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
"
L194256,L194256,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"But I think I am. I like to think I am.
"
L194255,L194255,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, I guess.
"
L194254,L194254,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
"
L194253,L194253,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
"
L194252,L194252,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
"
L194251,L194251,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know.
"
L194250,L194250,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
"
L194249,L194249,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah?
"
L194248,L194248,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
"
L194246,L194246,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
"
L194245,L194245,u861,m55,JOEL,"Thanks.
"
L194243,L194243,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I know a man who needs a refill.
"
L194242,L194242,u861,m55,JOEL,"No. I --
"
L194241,L194241,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
"
L194240,L194240,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I should probably get going.
"
L194237,L194237,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
"
L194236,L194236,u861,m55,JOEL,"You just say. I'm not really --
"
L194235,L194235,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You pick it.
"
L194234,L194234,u861,m55,JOEL,"What do you want to hear?
"
L194232,L194232,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, I'm okay for now.
"
L194231,L194231,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ready for another?
"
L194230,L194230,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
"
L194229,L194229,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm fine.
"
L194228,L194228,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
"
L194227,L194227,u861,m55,JOEL,"Cheers.
"
L194226,L194226,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
"
L194225,L194225,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's pretty.
"
L194224,L194224,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
"
L194223,L194223,u861,m55,JOEL,"Frost?
"
L194222,L194222,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
"
L194221,L194221,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know.
"
L194220,L194220,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
"
L194219,L194219,u861,m55,JOEL,"Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
"
L194218,L194218,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
"
L194217,L194217,u861,m55,JOEL,"Very much.
"
L194216,L194216,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You like that?
"
L194213,L194213,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
"
L194212,L194212,u861,m55,JOEL,"Um --
"
L194211,L194211,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
"
L194210,L194210,u861,m55,JOEL,"Take care.
"
L194209,L194209,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
"
L194208,L194208,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I wouldn't want to be --
"
L194207,L194207,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
"
L194206,L194206,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm just a bit of a wreck. ""I sleep in your hat"" makes me cry.  Me.
"
L194205,L194205,u861,m55,JOEL,"What?
"
L194204,L194204,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Remember? ""And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat...""  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
"
L194203,L194203,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sort of, um...
"
L194202,L194202,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. ""Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen."" Remember?
"
L194201,L194201,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
"
L194200,L194200,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
"
L194199,L194199,u861,m55,JOEL,"I like to read.
"
L194198,L194198,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"So you like bookstores, huh?
"
L194197,L194197,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's okay. I didn't think you were.
"
L194196,L194196,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
"
L194195,L194195,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Wilmont. Near the high school.
"
L194194,L194194,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah.
"
L194193,L194193,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You know Wilmont?
"
L194192,L194192,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm not a stalker.
"
L194191,L194191,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
"
L194190,L194190,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
"
L194189,L194189,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"You're not a stalker or anything, right?
"
L194188,L194188,u861,m55,JOEL,"Where do you live?
"
L194187,L194187,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah?
"
L194186,L194186,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's okay.
"
L194185,L194185,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't want to take you out of your way.
"
L194184,L194184,u861,m55,JOEL,"You're sure? It's cold.
"
L194183,L194183,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
"
L194182,L194182,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
"
L194181,L194181,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
"
L194180,L194180,u861,m55,JOEL,"Probably see you at the book store.
"
L194179,L194179,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
"
L194178,L194178,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
"
L194177,L194177,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, ""that's okay"" to me. That was nice of you.
"
L194176,L194176,u861,m55,JOEL,"That's okay.
"
L194175,L194175,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
"
L194174,L194174,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yes?
"
L194173,L194173,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Joel? It's Joel, right?
"
L194170,L194170,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
"
L194169,L194169,u861,m55,JOEL,"Okay.
"
L194168,L194168,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
"
L194163,L194163,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, anyway... Sorry.
"
L194162,L194162,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
"
L194161,L194161,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
"
L194160,L194160,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Why wouldn't you think that about me?
"
L194159,L194159,u861,m55,JOEL,"See, I wouldn't think that about you.
"
L194158,L194158,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
"
L194157,L194157,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means ""merciful"", right?
"
L194156,L194156,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
"
L194155,L194155,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm not nuts.
"
L194154,L194154,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
"
L194153,L194153,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know what that means.
"
L194152,L194152,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Huckleberry Hound?
"
L194151,L194151,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know any jokes about your name.
"
L194150,L194150,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
"
L194149,L194149,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm Joel.
"
L194148,L194148,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"My name's Clementine, by the way.
"
L194147,L194147,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Yeah, I got it.
"
L194146,L194146,u861,m55,JOEL,"Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
"
L194145,L194145,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
"
L194144,L194144,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh, I doubt that's the case.
"
L194143,L194143,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
"
L194142,L194142,u861,m55,JOEL,"You sure? That doesn't sound --
"
L194141,L194141,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
"
L194140,L194140,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm sure you would.
"
L194139,L194139,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
"
L194138,L194138,u861,m55,JOEL,"You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
"
L194137,L194137,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
"
L194136,L194136,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't really know how --
"
L194135,L194135,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
"
L194134,L194134,u861,m55,JOEL,"I can't remember.
"
L194133,L194133,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
"
L194132,L194132,u861,m55,JOEL,"Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
"
L194131,L194131,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
"
L194130,L194130,u861,m55,JOEL,"I like it.
"
L194129,L194129,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
"
L194128,L194128,u861,m55,JOEL,"I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
"
L194127,L194127,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
"
L194126,L194126,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't have one.
"
L194125,L194125,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
"
L194124,L194124,u861,m55,JOEL,"-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
"
L194123,L194123,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
"
L194122,L194122,u861,m55,JOEL,"Really? Because --
"
L194121,L194121,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
"
L194120,L194120,u861,m55,JOEL,"The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
"
L194119,L194119,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
"
L194118,L194118,u861,m55,JOEL,"Rockville Center.
"
L194117,L194117,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
"
L194116,L194116,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's okay, really.
"
L194115,L194115,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
"
L194114,L194114,u861,m55,JOEL,"I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
"
L194113,L194113,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Oh. So...
"
L194112,L194112,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
"
L194111,L194111,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
"
L194110,L194110,u861,m55,JOEL,"Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
"
L194109,L194109,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
"
L194108,L194108,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, I didn't want to assume.
"
L194107,L194107,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Really?
"
L194106,L194106,u861,m55,JOEL,"No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
"
L194105,L194105,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
"
L194104,L194104,u861,m55,JOEL,"Why what?
"
L194103,L194103,u859,m55,CLEMENTINE,"Why?
"
L194102,L194102,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm sorry.
"
L195096,L195096,u861,m55,JOEL,"Jesus.
"
L195094,L195094,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know. Panties and --
"
L195092,L195092,u861,m55,JOEL,"You must have been crazy.
"
L195090,L195090,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
"
L195088,L195088,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi, it's Joel.
"
L195057,L195057,u861,m55,JOEL,"Look, I have to go. I have to think.
"
L195055,L195055,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's true.
"
L195052,L195052,u861,m55,JOEL,"That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
"
L195050,L195050,u861,m55,JOEL,"I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
"
L195048,L195048,u861,m55,JOEL,"Did you send this? Is it a joke?
"
L195023,L195023,u861,m55,JOEL,"I guess so.
"
L195021,L195021,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oddly enough, I do.
"
L195019,L195019,u861,m55,JOEL,"I just walked in.
"
L195012,L195012,u861,m55,JOEL,"There you are.  Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
"
L195007,L195007,u861,m55,JOEL,"I just got in.
"
L195005,L195005,u861,m55,JOEL,"I know. I had to take the day to think.
"
L195003,L195003,u861,m55,JOEL,"How's it going?
"
L195001,L195001,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
"
L194939,L194939,u861,m55,JOEL,"I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
"
L194925,L194925,u861,m55,JOEL,"Clementine.
"
L194892,L194892,u861,m55,JOEL,"So you're still on the Zoloft?
"
L194861,L194861,u861,m55,JOEL,"But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
"
L194859,L194859,u861,m55,JOEL,"Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
"
L194840,L194840,u861,m55,JOEL,"Okay. I wish you could come.
"
L194778,L194778,u861,m55,JOEL,"Naomi.
"
L194690,L194690,u861,m55,JOEL,"I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
"
L194583,L194583,u861,m55,JOEL,"I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
"
L194521,L194521,u861,m55,JOEL,"How's the chicken?
"
L194432,L194432,u861,m55,JOEL,"And what are you like? A wino?
"
L194382,L194382,u861,m55,JOEL,"Any messages, Carmen?
"
L194380,L194380,u861,m55,JOEL,"So then she just stops calling.
"
L194336,L194336,u861,m55,JOEL,"Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
"
L194321,L194321,u861,m55,JOEL,"Clementine.
"
L194319,L194319,u861,m55,JOEL,"I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
"
L194317,L194317,u861,m55,JOEL,"I should maybe talk to you.
"
L194314,L194314,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's them.
"
L194309,L194309,u861,m55,JOEL,"Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
"
L194308,L194308,u861,m55,JOEL,"Fuck you, Clementine.
"
L194306,L194306,u861,m55,JOEL,"I might be making a mistake.
"
L194303,L194303,u861,m55,JOEL,"The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
"
L194301,L194301,u861,m55,JOEL,"It was snowing.
"
L194568,L194568,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
"
L194566,L194566,u861,m55,JOEL,"You have to stop this!
"
L194372,L194372,u861,m55,JOEL,"It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
"
L194370,L194370,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well... I did.
"
L194345,L194345,u861,m55,JOEL,"Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
"
L195016,L195016,u861,m55,JOEL,"We'll speak soon.
"
L195014,L195014,u861,m55,JOEL,"I had a good time last night. I really did.
"
L194993,L194993,u861,m55,JOEL,"So you think the dissertation will get published?
"
L194991,L194991,u861,m55,JOEL,"I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
"
L194989,L194989,u861,m55,JOEL,"Oh! Great. That's great!
"
L194987,L194987,u861,m55,JOEL,"I miss you.
"
L194985,L194985,u861,m55,JOEL,"Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
"
L194983,L194983,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
"
L194844,L194844,u861,m55,JOEL,"I hope you get your work done.
"
L194838,L194838,u861,m55,JOEL,"So you don't mind?
"
L194836,L194836,u861,m55,JOEL,"In a minute.
"
L194834,L194834,u861,m55,JOEL,"Go back to sleep.
"
L194832,L194832,u861,m55,JOEL,"You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
"
L194830,L194830,u861,m55,JOEL,"Hi.
"
L194798,L194798,u861,m55,JOEL,"It's not somebody else.
"
L194796,L194796,u861,m55,JOEL,"No. I just need some space, maybe.
"
L194794,L194794,u861,m55,JOEL,"I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
"
L194792,L194792,u861,m55,JOEL,"Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
"
L194790,L194790,u861,m55,JOEL,"I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
"
L194784,L194784,u861,m55,JOEL,"Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
"
L194783,L194783,u861,m55,JOEL,"You take it. I don't know.
"
L480092,L480092,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes.
"
L479932,L479932,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Right.
"
L479729,L479729,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
"
L479727,L479727,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm not running.
"
L479725,L479725,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You don't understand this guy.
"
L479723,L479723,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
"
L479718,L479718,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
"
L479715,L479715,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What is he up to now?
"
L479762,L479762,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Of course.
"
L479760,L479760,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Of course.
"
L479758,L479758,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
"
L479756,L479756,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
"
L479752,L479752,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
"
L479750,L479750,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Good one!  Thanks.
"
L479748,L479748,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"And what did you say?
"
L479743,L479743,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What did he ask?
"
L479741,L479741,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
"
L480171,L480171,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"He's here!... He's here!
"
L480167,L480167,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It's hurting.
"
L480163,L480163,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Eight is good... ""V"" could be Victory.
"
L479579,L479579,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
"
L480288,L480288,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
"
L480286,L480286,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"""I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me"".
"
L480284,L480284,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I was, because if you said ""yes"" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
"
L480276,L480276,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
"
L480270,L480270,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
"
L480268,L480268,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
"
L480266,L480266,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
"
L480264,L480264,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It's something I've always wanted to do.
"
L480260,L480260,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
"
L480145,L480145,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"So, we'll...
"
L480143,L480143,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm okay with that.
"
L480141,L480141,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"And the church.
"
L480139,L480139,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes, you!
"
L480137,L480137,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"To who?  Are you asking me?
"
L480135,L480135,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I love you, too.
"
L480133,L480133,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Me, either.
"
L480131,L480131,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
"
L480124,L480124,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Really?
"
L480122,L480122,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"About a minute...?
"
L480120,L480120,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I kissed him back.
"
L480100,L480100,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
"
L480098,L480098,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
"
L480088,L480088,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes I do!
"
L480086,L480086,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"That's called changing your mind.
"
L480084,L480084,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What!?
"
L480082,L480082,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Lost!
"
L480080,L480080,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
"
L480078,L480078,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Brian told you that?
"
L480076,L480076,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I already explained about that.
"
L480074,L480074,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"That was very interesting research George was doing!
"
L480072,L480072,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It's fun!  It's high.
"
L480070,L480070,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
"
L480068,L480068,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You humiliated me!
"
L480056,L480056,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes.
"
L480054,L480054,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Excuse me?
"
L480043,L480043,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Where did you disappear to?
"
L479979,L479979,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
"
L479973,L479973,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
"
L479971,L479971,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
"
L479969,L479969,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
"
L479967,L479967,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
"
L479961,L479961,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
"
L479952,L479952,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
"
L479950,L479950,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No.  You take it.
"
L479948,L479948,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
"
L479939,L479939,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Ike... Hi, Grandma.
"
L479935,L479935,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You know, there's no...
"
L479930,L479930,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
"
L479928,L479928,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'll have the same.
"
L479922,L479922,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
"
L479897,L479897,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
"
L479893,L479893,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
"
L479891,L479891,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You don't know.
"
L479889,L479889,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
"
L479887,L479887,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"So?  Is that what you said to her?
"
L479883,L479883,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
"
L479881,L479881,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
"
L479879,L479879,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
"
L479877,L479877,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Still sweet.
"
L479874,L479874,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
"
L479872,L479872,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
"
L479870,L479870,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Maybe someday.
"
L479868,L479868,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I think so.
"
L479864,L479864,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
"
L479861,L479861,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Six-fifty.
"
L479859,L479859,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Seven-fifty.
"
L479857,L479857,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
"
L479855,L479855,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
"
L479851,L479851,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
"
L479849,L479849,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
"
L479847,L479847,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
"
L479810,L479810,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
"
L479808,L479808,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
"
L479783,L479783,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"He is not!
"
L479770,L479770,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Give me that!
"
L479700,L479700,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
"
L479683,L479683,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"We think so.
"
L479680,L479680,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Without oxygen...
"
L479678,L479678,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Twice...
"
L479672,L479672,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
"
L479642,L479642,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
"
L479640,L479640,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You're going to be very disappointed.
"
L479638,L479638,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Did something happen to make you care about reality?
"
L479636,L479636,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You have one?
"
L479620,L479620,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes.
"
L479618,L479618,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
"
L479613,L479613,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
"
L479601,L479601,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Excellent.
"
L479599,L479599,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
"
L480237,L480237,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Thank you.  You still think that he was....
"
L480235,L480235,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"What are you talking about?
"
L480233,L480233,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No, I'm just going to head home.
"
L480231,L480231,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm just finishing up, too.
"
L480210,L480210,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
"
L480160,L480160,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
"
L480158,L480158,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
"
L480152,L480152,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Grandma!
"
L480105,L480105,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
"
L480103,L480103,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
"
L480037,L480037,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
"
L480035,L480035,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Lighten up, what?
"
L479844,L479844,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
"
L479842,L479842,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
"
L479840,L479840,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
"
L479838,L479838,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
"
L479836,L479836,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"But I'm weird.
"
L479834,L479834,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
"
L479832,L479832,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Because you think I'm all like... ""Hey man, check me out"".
"
L479830,L479830,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm going to kill myself.
"
L479828,L479828,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
"
L479824,L479824,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
"
L479794,L479794,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those ""sources say"" things.
"
L479792,L479792,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
"
L479790,L479790,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Ya think?
"
L479788,L479788,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
"
L479786,L479786,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
"
L479603,L479603,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"She's the boss.
"
L479597,L479597,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Reporter?
"
L479581,L479581,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
"
L479523,L479523,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
"
L480255,L480255,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
"
L480253,L480253,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"No.  It's my life.
"
L480251,L480251,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
"
L480207,L480207,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Thank you, Dad.
"
L479957,L479957,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
"
L479955,L479955,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
"
L479670,L479670,u7367,m498,MAGGIE,"Not this one.  This one's on me.
"
L422762,L422762,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Lovely to meet you.
"
L422727,L422727,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm a vegetarian.
"
L422716,L422716,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
"
L422675,L422675,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Hi.
"
L422765,L422765,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Night, night, Honey.
"
L422761,L422761,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
"
L422759,L422759,u6896,m462,ANNA,"And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
"
L422757,L422757,u6896,m462,ANNA,"That was such a great evening.
"
L422749,L422749,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well... a shot at it.
"
L422747,L422747,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Wait a minute.  What about me?
"
L423173,L423173,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
"
L423171,L423171,u6896,m462,ANNA,"And then I... right.
"
L423169,L423169,u6896,m462,ANNA,"So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
"
L423168,L423168,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
"
L423166,L423166,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm not listening.
"
L423163,L423163,u6896,m462,ANNA,"We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
"
L422713,L422713,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Fifteen million dollars.
"
L422711,L422711,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Films mainly.
"
L422709,L422709,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, they can be.
"
L422707,L422707,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm an actress.
"
L423309,L423309,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
"
L423302,L423302,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
"
L423226,L423226,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
"
L423224,L423224,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
"
L423221,L423221,u6896,m462,ANNA,"... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
"
L423218,L423218,u6896,m462,ANNA,"That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
"
L423204,L423204,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
"
L423202,L423202,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
"
L423197,L423197,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
"
L423195,L423195,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
"
L423193,L423193,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I thought I'd give it to you.
"
L423192,L423192,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
"
L423190,L423190,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well... how have you been?
"
L423188,L423188,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You disappeared.
"
L423186,L423186,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Hi.
"
L423155,L423155,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
"
L423153,L423153,u6896,m462,ANNA,"But... wait... there are things to say.
"
L423151,L423151,u6896,m462,ANNA,"It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
"
L423149,L423149,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
"
L423147,L423147,u6896,m462,ANNA,"This is certainly... ah...
"
L423099,L423099,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
"
L423097,L423097,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Excuse me?
"
L423095,L423095,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
"
L423091,L423091,u6896,m462,ANNA,"And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
"
L423088,L423088,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
"
L423086,L423086,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
"
L423084,L423084,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
"
L423082,L423082,u6896,m462,ANNA,"As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
"
L423080,L423080,u6896,m462,ANNA,"This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
"
L423077,L423077,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
"
L423075,L423075,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
"
L423073,L423073,u6896,m462,ANNA,"How do you think I'm doing?
"
L423064,L423064,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Jesus.
"
L423062,L423062,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
"
L423059,L423059,u6896,m462,ANNA,"What?
"
L423056,L423056,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Damn, I forgot the jam.
"
L423054,L423054,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Can I stay a bit longer?
"
L423051,L423051,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh.
"
L423049,L423049,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
"
L423047,L423047,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
"
L423044,L423044,u6896,m462,ANNA,"But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
"
L423042,L423042,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
"
L423040,L423040,u6896,m462,ANNA,"What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
"
L423038,L423038,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You and every person in this country.
"
L423035,L423035,u6896,m462,ANNA,"What?
"
L423032,L423032,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Okay.
"
L423014,L423014,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Right.
"
L423012,L423012,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
"
L423011,L423011,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Both.
"
L423009,L423009,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
"
L423007,L423007,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
"
L423005,L423005,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
"
L423003,L423003,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
"
L423001,L423001,u6896,m462,ANNA,"The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
"
L423000,L423000,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Big feet -- large shoes.
"
L422998,L422998,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You know what they say about men with big feet?
"
L422996,L422996,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You've got big feet.
"
L422991,L422991,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
"
L422989,L422989,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
"
L422985,L422985,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
"
L422983,L422983,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You think I should do Henry James instead?
"
L422981,L422981,u6896,m462,ANNA,"What do you think?
"
L422979,L422979,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, get a message through to him too.
"
L422977,L422977,u6896,m462,ANNA,"My son's name is Johnny?
"
L422975,L422975,u6896,m462,ANNA,"'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
"
L422973,L422973,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
"
L422971,L422971,u6896,m462,ANNA,"'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
"
L422969,L422969,u6896,m462,ANNA,"'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
"
L422966,L422966,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
"
L422964,L422964,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
"
L422962,L422962,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
"
L422960,L422960,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
"
L422958,L422958,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I have thought about you.
"
L422956,L422956,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
"
L422954,L422954,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
"
L422948,L422948,u6896,m462,ANNA,"A bath would be great.
"
L422946,L422946,u6896,m462,ANNA,"These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
"
L422945,L422945,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
"
L422943,L422943,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
"
L422940,L422940,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Hi.  Can I come in?
"
L422886,L422886,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
"
L422859,L422859,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
"
L422857,L422857,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You've got to go.
"
L422852,L422852,u6896,m462,ANNA,"There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
"
L422850,L422850,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
"
L422849,L422849,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I don't know either.
"
L422847,L422847,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
"
L422845,L422845,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
"
L422837,L422837,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
"
L422820,L422820,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Uh-oh.  That's not good.
"
L422818,L422818,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Why?
"
L422816,L422816,u6896,m462,ANNA,"So who left who?
"
L422800,L422800,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Step aside.
"
L422796,L422796,u6896,m462,ANNA,"There's no 'unless.'  No one has said ""whoopsidaisies"" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
"
L422794,L422794,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
"
L422792,L422792,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes, you did.
"
L422790,L422790,u6896,m462,ANNA,"What did you say?
"
L422786,L422786,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You abide by rules like that?
"
L422784,L422784,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Let's go in.
"
L422781,L422781,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I was.
"
L422779,L422779,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Busy tomorrow?
"
L422777,L422777,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Too complicated.
"
L422774,L422774,u6896,m462,ANNA,"And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
"
L422772,L422772,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Why is she in a wheelchair?
"
L422770,L422770,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Floppy, huh?
"
L422751,L422751,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
"
L422664,L422664,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Okay.
"
L422662,L422662,u6896,m462,ANNA,"If that's all right.
"
L422660,L422660,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
"
L422658,L422658,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Okay -- fine.
"
L422656,L422656,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
"
L422619,L422619,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
"
L422618,L422618,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes.
"
L422611,L422611,u6896,m462,ANNA,"And what happens next in the dream?
"
L422605,L422605,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
"
L422602,L422602,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
"
L422595,L422595,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
"
L422591,L422591,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Hello.
"
L422567,L422567,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
"
L422565,L422565,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh -- Okay.
"
L422563,L422563,u6896,m462,ANNA,"You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
"
L422561,L422561,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Hi.
"
L422507,L422507,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Bye.
"
L422505,L422505,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Probably best not tell anyone about this.
"
L422499,L422499,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
"
L422497,L422497,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Thanks.  Well...
"
L422494,L422494,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I forgot my bag.
"
L422488,L422488,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Thank you.
"
L422485,L422485,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
"
L422483,L422483,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No.
"
L422481,L422481,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Really, no.
"
L422478,L422478,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No.
"
L422476,L422476,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No thanks.
"
L422470,L422470,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
"
L422468,L422468,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
"
L422464,L422464,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Oh Jesus.
"
L422434,L422434,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
"
L422418,L422418,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Thanks.  I'll think about it.
"
L422415,L422415,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Really?
"
L422412,L422412,u6896,m462,ANNA,"No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
"
L422882,L422882,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I haven't decided.
"
L422880,L422880,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Nice surprise.
"
L422874,L422874,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
"
L422861,L422861,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes...
"
L422444,L422444,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Tempting but... no, thank you.
"
L422442,L422442,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
"
L422439,L422439,u6896,m462,ANNA,"What's your name?
"
L422437,L422437,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Yes.
"
L423214,L423214,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
"
L423212,L423212,u6896,m462,ANNA,"I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
"
L423210,L423210,u6896,m462,ANNA,"Is that right?
"
L343647,L343647,u1755,m116,BEN,"Water.
"
L343645,L343645,u1755,m116,BEN,"Water?
"
L343643,L343643,u1755,m116,BEN,"No.
"
L343641,L343641,u1755,m116,BEN,"No.
"
L343639,L343639,u1755,m116,BEN,"No.
"
L343637,L343637,u1755,m116,BEN,"...Noooo.
"
L343635,L343635,u1755,m116,BEN,"What do you think I should get?
"
L343633,L343633,u1755,m116,BEN,"No alcohol?
"
L343631,L343631,u1755,m116,BEN,"What are my choices?
"
L343629,L343629,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
"
L344081,L344081,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes.
"
L344080,L344080,u1755,m116,BEN,"You know I love you... yeah?
"
L344075,L344075,u1758,m116,SERA,"Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
"
L344074,L344074,u1755,m116,BEN,"I wanted to see you...
"
L344030,L344030,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes... I guess I knew that.
"
L344029,L344029,u1758,m116,SERA,"There are limits.
"
L344021,L344021,u1758,m116,SERA,"One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
"
L344020,L344020,u1755,m116,BEN,"Will you lighten up, please?
"
L344019,L344019,u1758,m116,SERA,"And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
"
L344018,L344018,u1755,m116,BEN,"Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
"
L343997,L343997,u1755,m116,BEN,"I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
"
L343996,L343996,u1758,m116,SERA,"I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
"
L343995,L343995,u1755,m116,BEN,"OK.
"
L343994,L343994,u1758,m116,SERA,"Let's stay for a while.
"
L343993,L343993,u1755,m116,BEN,"I like it here with you.
"
L343992,L343992,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
"
L343991,L343991,u1755,m116,BEN,"Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
"
L343990,L343990,u1758,m116,SERA,"Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
"
L343989,L343989,u1755,m116,BEN,"Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
"
L343988,L343988,u1758,m116,SERA,"Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
"
L343986,L343986,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yeah... I'd like that.
"
L343985,L343985,u1758,m116,SERA,"Shall we go away for a couple of days?
"
L343984,L343984,u1755,m116,BEN,"You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
"
L343983,L343983,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
"
L343981,L343981,u1758,m116,SERA,"They wouldn't know.
"
L343980,L343980,u1755,m116,BEN,"Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
"
L343978,L343978,u1755,m116,BEN,"No... we already talked about that.
"
L343977,L343977,u1758,m116,SERA,"Do you want me not to go tonight?
"
L343976,L343976,u1755,m116,BEN,"Thank you, Sera.
"
L343975,L343975,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes... I'll give you that.
"
L343974,L343974,u1755,m116,BEN,"Please!
"
L343973,L343973,u1755,m116,BEN,"Can we just ignore it?
"
L343972,L343972,u1758,m116,SERA,"I don't understand any of that.
"
L343971,L343971,u1755,m116,BEN,"Can we just forget it?
"
L343970,L343970,u1758,m116,SERA,"What was that all about?
"
L343962,L343962,u1755,m116,BEN,"I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
"
L343961,L343961,u1758,m116,SERA,"Your color.
"
L343957,L343957,u1755,m116,BEN,"OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
"
L343956,L343956,u1758,m116,SERA,"Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
"
L343920,L343920,u1758,m116,SERA,"Be careful.
"
L343919,L343919,u1755,m116,BEN,"Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
"
L343917,L343917,u1755,m116,BEN,"That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
"
L343916,L343916,u1758,m116,SERA,"Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
"
L343915,L343915,u1755,m116,BEN,"I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
"
L343914,L343914,u1758,m116,SERA,"You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
"
L343911,L343911,u1755,m116,BEN,"We?
"
L343910,L343910,u1758,m116,SERA,"I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
"
L343909,L343909,u1755,m116,BEN,"That's impressive. How did you do that?
"
L343908,L343908,u1758,m116,SERA,"I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
"
L343907,L343907,u1755,m116,BEN,"Oh, and what did you do?
"
L343906,L343906,u1758,m116,SERA,"Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
"
L343905,L343905,u1755,m116,BEN,"Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
"
L343904,L343904,u1758,m116,SERA,"How are you doing?
"
L343901,L343901,u1758,m116,SERA,"I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
"
L343900,L343900,u1755,m116,BEN,"What do you mean?
"
L343899,L343899,u1758,m116,SERA,"Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
"
L343898,L343898,u1755,m116,BEN,"I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
"
L343896,L343896,u1758,m116,SERA,"Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
"
L343895,L343895,u1755,m116,BEN,"When?
"
L343894,L343894,u1758,m116,SERA,"I am planning to go out and do some work.
"
L343893,L343893,u1758,m116,SERA,"Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
"
L343892,L343892,u1755,m116,BEN,"Giving you money makes me want to come.
"
L343890,L343890,u1758,m116,SERA,"Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
"
L343889,L343889,u1755,m116,BEN,"I'm going to fill it right now.
"
L343885,L343885,u1758,m116,SERA,"Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
"
L343884,L343884,u1755,m116,BEN,"I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
"
L343883,L343883,u1758,m116,SERA,"Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
"
L343879,L343879,u1758,m116,SERA,"Whatever that means. Open your presents.
"
L343878,L343878,u1755,m116,BEN,"Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
"
L343877,L343877,u1758,m116,SERA,"Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
"
L343876,L343876,u1755,m116,BEN,"...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
"
L343875,L343875,u1758,m116,SERA,"I know that...
"
L343874,L343874,u1755,m116,BEN,"No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
"
L343873,L343873,u1758,m116,SERA,"No?
"
L343872,L343872,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
"
L343871,L343871,u1758,m116,SERA,"Well... OK...
"
L343870,L343870,u1755,m116,BEN,"Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
"
L343869,L343869,u1758,m116,SERA,"Why?
"
L343868,L343868,u1755,m116,BEN,"I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
"
L343867,L343867,u1758,m116,SERA,"OK.
"
L343866,L343866,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
"
L343863,L343863,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sorry.
"
L343862,L343862,u1758,m116,SERA,"Ben?
"
L343859,L343859,u1755,m116,BEN,"Of course.
"
L343858,L343858,u1758,m116,SERA,"Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
"
L343857,L343857,u1755,m116,BEN,"Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
"
L343855,L343855,u1755,m116,BEN,"Right... OK...
"
L343854,L343854,u1758,m116,SERA,"Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
"
L343853,L343853,u1755,m116,BEN,"Hi!
"
L343845,L343845,u1758,m116,SERA,"I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
"
L343844,L343844,u1755,m116,BEN,"You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
"
L343843,L343843,u1758,m116,SERA,"What?
"
L343842,L343842,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera... what you don't understand is...
"
L343839,L343839,u1755,m116,BEN,"Don't be silly?
"
L343838,L343838,u1758,m116,SERA,"Don't you like me, Ben?
"
L343835,L343835,u1755,m116,BEN,"You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
"
L343834,L343834,u1758,m116,SERA,"That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
"
L343833,L343833,u1755,m116,BEN,"Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
"
L343832,L343832,u1758,m116,SERA,"So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
"
L343831,L343831,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera you are crazy.
"
L343830,L343830,u1758,m116,SERA,"So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
"
L343829,L343829,u1755,m116,BEN,"Me neither.
"
L343828,L343828,u1758,m116,SERA,"Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
"
L343827,L343827,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera...
"
L343826,L343826,u1758,m116,SERA,"What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
"
L343825,L343825,u1755,m116,BEN,"What do you mean?
"
L343824,L343824,u1758,m116,SERA,"There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
"
L343823,L343823,u1755,m116,BEN,"I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
"
L343822,L343822,u1758,m116,SERA,"Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
"
L343821,L343821,u1755,m116,BEN,"How long have I been here?
"
L343820,L343820,u1758,m116,SERA,"It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
"
L343819,L343819,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
"
L343818,L343818,u1758,m116,SERA,"Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
"
L343817,L343817,u1755,m116,BEN,"I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
"
L343816,L343816,u1758,m116,SERA,"Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
"
L343815,L343815,u1758,m116,SERA,"I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
"
L343814,L343814,u1755,m116,BEN,"That's astonishing. Sera, look...
"
L343813,L343813,u1758,m116,SERA,"Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
"
L343812,L343812,u1755,m116,BEN,"What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
"
L343811,L343811,u1758,m116,SERA,"It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
"
L343808,L343808,u1758,m116,SERA,"Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
"
L343807,L343807,u1755,m116,BEN,"Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
"
L343806,L343806,u1758,m116,SERA,"First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
"
L343805,L343805,u1758,m116,SERA,"Very clever.
"
L343804,L343804,u1755,m116,BEN,"Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
"
L343803,L343803,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes.
"
L343802,L343802,u1755,m116,BEN,"Is that really what you want to ask me?
"
L343801,L343801,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
"
L343800,L343800,u1755,m116,BEN,"Do they have drinks?
"
L343799,L343799,u1758,m116,SERA,"I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
"
L343798,L343798,u1755,m116,BEN,"I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
"
L343797,L343797,u1755,m116,BEN,"Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
"
L343796,L343796,u1758,m116,SERA,"Thank you. What time is it?
"
L343795,L343795,u1755,m116,BEN,"Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
"
L343794,L343794,u1758,m116,SERA,"You OK?
"
L343792,L343792,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
"
L343791,L343791,u1758,m116,SERA,"You OK out there?
"
L343790,L343790,u1755,m116,BEN,"This is the home of an angel.
"
L343789,L343789,u1755,m116,BEN,"You do?
"
L343788,L343788,u1758,m116,SERA,"We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
"
L343787,L343787,u1758,m116,SERA,"I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
"
L343786,L343786,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes.
"
L343768,L343768,u1758,m116,SERA,"No, I can't have dinner with you.
"
L343767,L343767,u1755,m116,BEN,"I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
"
L343766,L343766,u1758,m116,SERA,"Are you serious.
"
L343765,L343765,u1755,m116,BEN,"...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
"
L343764,L343764,u1755,m116,BEN,"I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
"
L343763,L343763,u1758,m116,SERA,"What's up?
"
L343762,L343762,u1758,m116,SERA,"Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
"
L343761,L343761,u1755,m116,BEN,"Don't run away.
"
L343760,L343760,u1755,m116,BEN,"I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
"
L343759,L343759,u1758,m116,SERA,"No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
"
L343758,L343758,u1755,m116,BEN,"If I was I'm sorry.
"
L343727,L343727,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
"
L343726,L343726,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
"
L343725,L343725,u1755,m116,BEN,"I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
"
L343724,L343724,u1758,m116,SERA,"How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
"
L343723,L343723,u1755,m116,BEN,"I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
"
L343722,L343722,u1755,m116,BEN,"Yes, that's right.
"
L343721,L343721,u1758,m116,SERA,"To death?
"
L343720,L343720,u1755,m116,BEN,"No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
"
L343718,L343718,u1755,m116,BEN,"I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
"
L343717,L343717,u1758,m116,SERA,"What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
"
L343716,L343716,u1758,m116,SERA,"OK... whatever.
"
L343715,L343715,u1755,m116,BEN,"Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
"
L343714,L343714,u1758,m116,SERA,"Do you want to fuck now?
"
L343712,L343712,u1755,m116,BEN,"Of course.
"
L343711,L343711,u1758,m116,SERA,"A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
"
L343710,L343710,u1755,m116,BEN,"Want a drink? I'm having one.
"
L343709,L343709,u1755,m116,BEN,"Of course.
"
L343708,L343708,u1758,m116,SERA,"Mind if I use the bathroom?
"
L343705,L343705,u1758,m116,SERA,"You were going to get my door.
"
L343704,L343704,u1755,m116,BEN,"Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
"
L343703,L343703,u1758,m116,SERA,"I sometimes fade out.
"
L343702,L343702,u1755,m116,BEN,"You what?
"
L343701,L343701,u1758,m116,SERA,"I guess I do too.
"
L343700,L343700,u1755,m116,BEN,"Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
"
L343699,L343699,u1758,m116,SERA,"Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
"
L343697,L343697,u1758,m116,SERA,"No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
"
L343696,L343696,u1755,m116,BEN,"We can go to one if you'd prefer.
"
L343695,L343695,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
"
L343693,L343693,u1758,m116,SERA,"No -- S.E.R.A.
"
L343692,L343692,u1755,m116,BEN,"Sarah -- with an H?
"
L343686,L343686,u1755,m116,BEN,"Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
"
L343685,L343685,u1758,m116,SERA,"You're pretty drunk.
"
L343684,L343684,u1758,m116,SERA,"Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
"
L343683,L343683,u1755,m116,BEN,"That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
"
L343682,L343682,u1755,m116,BEN,"That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
"
L343681,L343681,u1758,m116,SERA,"Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
"
L343680,L343680,u1758,m116,SERA,"Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
"
L343679,L343679,u1755,m116,BEN,"Are you working?
"
L343678,L343678,u1758,m116,SERA,"Hello.
"
L343677,L343677,u1755,m116,BEN,"Hello!
"
L343584,L343584,u1755,m116,BEN,"I don't know. I'll find out though.
"
L343582,L343582,u1755,m116,BEN,"The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
"
L343580,L343580,u1755,m116,BEN,"How'd this happen?
"
L343578,L343578,u1755,m116,BEN,"What did they look like?
"
L343576,L343576,u1755,m116,BEN,"Hey, Brad... how's it going?
"
L343753,L343753,u1758,m116,SERA,"Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
"
L343752,L343752,u1758,m116,SERA,"I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
"
L343750,L343750,u1758,m116,SERA,"Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
"
L343748,L343748,u1758,m116,SERA,"Where are you staying?
"
L343746,L343746,u1758,m116,SERA,"So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
"
L343743,L343743,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
"
L343780,L343780,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yuri... are you...
"
L343776,L343776,u1758,m116,SERA,"No.
"
L343771,L343771,u1758,m116,SERA,"It's me, Yuri.
"
L343735,L343735,u1758,m116,SERA,"Don't hit me.
"
L343734,L343734,u1758,m116,SERA,"Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
"
L343732,L343732,u1758,m116,SERA,"It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
"
L343606,L343606,u1758,m116,SERA,"Yes, of course. How much do you need?
"
L343601,L343601,u1758,m116,SERA,"Where have you been staying?
"
L343591,L343591,u1758,m116,SERA,"I am lonely, Yuri.
"
L343588,L343588,u1758,m116,SERA,"I've been all right.
"
L343546,L343546,u1758,m116,SERA,"Please, Yuri.
"
L343544,L343544,u1758,m116,SERA,"I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
"
L51892,L51892,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
"
L51614,L51614,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I love you.
"
L51610,L51610,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
"
L51524,L51524,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What is it you want? What?
"
L51523,L51523,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
"
L51521,L51521,u3777,m249,CAROL,"... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
"
L51519,L51519,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
"
L51517,L51517,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
"
L51515,L51515,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
"
L51513,L51513,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
"
L51450,L51450,u3777,m249,CAROL,"It lets a crazy man into our lives.
"
L51448,L51448,u3777,m249,CAROL,"There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
"
L51402,L51402,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Huh?
"
L51530,L51530,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Do you love me?
"
L51405,L51405,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Stay out of this...  Doctor?
"
L51400,L51400,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
"
L51180,L51180,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Don't be silly. How bad?
"
L51434,L51434,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
"
L51432,L51432,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No.
"
L51430,L51430,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
"
L51429,L51429,u3777,m249,CAROL,"His home number.
"
L51427,L51427,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
"
L51425,L51425,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
"
L51423,L51423,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
"
L51421,L51421,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No.
"
L51419,L51419,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Emergency room only.
"
L51417,L51417,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Yes.
"
L51415,L51415,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Since forever.
"
L51407,L51407,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm a waitress.
"
L51398,L51398,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
"
L51396,L51396,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
"
L51394,L51394,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
"
L51910,L51910,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
"
L51909,L51909,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
"
L51907,L51907,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Just let me talk.  I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
"
L51906,L51906,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You know what? I...
"
L51905,L51905,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
"
L51904,L51904,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
"
L51903,L51903,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
"
L51901,L51901,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Okay.
"
L51900,L51900,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
"
L51899,L51899,u3777,m249,CAROL,"See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
"
L51898,L51898,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
"
L51896,L51896,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
"
L51895,L51895,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
"
L51894,L51894,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Boyfriend?
"
L51890,L51890,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
"
L51889,L51889,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Because...
"
L51888,L51888,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I had to see you...
"
L51887,L51887,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Is it a secret what you're doing here?
"
L51886,L51886,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What a break...
"
L51885,L51885,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I wasn't asleep!!
"
L51883,L51883,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What are you doing here?
"
L51882,L51882,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Were you asleep?
"
L51881,L51881,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What job?
"
L51880,L51880,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
"
L51879,L51879,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Grouchy?
"
L51878,L51878,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
"
L51877,L51877,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What do you want?
"
L51876,L51876,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Were you asleep?
"
L51875,L51875,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What do you want, Melvin?
"
L51853,L51853,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"So long.
"
L51852,L51852,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Okay. Good-bye.
"
L51851,L51851,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I should've danced with you.
"
L51850,L51850,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Go ahead.
"
L51849,L51849,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay to say something now?
"
L51847,L51847,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
"
L51846,L51846,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Cute.
"
L51845,L51845,u3777,m249,CAROL,"See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
"
L51844,L51844,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"The two might go together.
"
L51843,L51843,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
"
L51842,L51842,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"That seems like a good choice.
"
L51841,L51841,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I can trust my brain.
"
L51840,L51840,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"How you doing?
"
L51839,L51839,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Yeah... Well...
"
L51838,L51838,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hello.
"
L51813,L51813,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
"
L51812,L51812,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'll take you... why not?
"
L51811,L51811,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'll take a bus.
"
L51810,L51810,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
"
L51809,L51809,u3777,m249,CAROL,"It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
"
L51808,L51808,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"This one has a special meaning.
"
L51807,L51807,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't.
"
L51806,L51806,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What do you mean? You said you liked it.
"
L51805,L51805,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't want to hear that music right now.
"
L51801,L51801,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
"
L51800,L51800,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
"
L51799,L51799,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
"
L51783,L51783,u3777,m249,CAROL,"To hell with sex.
"
L51782,L51782,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
"
L51751,L51751,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It was a mistake.
"
L51750,L51750,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'll never forget you said it.
"
L51749,L51749,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
"
L51748,L51748,u3777,m249,CAROL,"That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
"
L51747,L51747,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It's one idea...
"
L51746,L51746,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Sex with Simon?
"
L51745,L51745,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
"
L51744,L51744,u3777,m249,CAROL,"If you ask me... I'll say, ""yes.""
"
L51743,L51743,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
"
L51742,L51742,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Well, ah... that's a personal question.
"
L51741,L51741,u3777,m249,CAROL,"That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
"
L51740,L51740,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You don't owe me that.
"
L51739,L51739,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Here's the trouble with never.
"
L51738,L51738,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Never.
"
L51737,L51737,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
"
L51736,L51736,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
"
L51735,L51735,u3777,m249,CAROL,"So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
"
L51734,L51734,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
"
L51733,L51733,u3777,m249,CAROL,"That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
"
L51731,L51731,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
"
L51730,L51730,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. ""Hate,"" I am using the word ""hate"" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
"
L51729,L51729,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
"
L51726,L51726,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"One baked -- one fries.
"
L51725,L51725,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Fries.
"
L51724,L51724,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
"
L51723,L51723,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Can we order first?
"
L51722,L51722,u3777,m249,CAROL,"And mean it...
"
L51721,L51721,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay.
"
L51720,L51720,u3777,m249,CAROL,"That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
"
L51719,L51719,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
"
L51718,L51718,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
"
L51717,L51717,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
"
L51716,L51716,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
"
L51715,L51715,u3777,m249,CAROL,"And?
"
L51714,L51714,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
"
L51713,L51713,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You wanna dance?
"
L51694,L51694,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
"
L51693,L51693,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
"
L51689,L51689,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
"
L51688,L51688,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Stop asking everyone.
"
L51676,L51676,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Dancing?
"
L51675,L51675,u3777,m249,CAROL,"My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
"
L51667,L51667,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
"
L51666,L51666,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
"
L51662,L51662,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No.
"
L51661,L51661,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
"
L51658,L51658,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
"
L51657,L51657,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
"
L51654,L51654,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You like sad stories -- you want mine.
"
L51653,L51653,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Hey -- you let him...
"
L51645,L51645,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
"
L51644,L51644,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Nonsense!
"
L51643,L51643,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
"
L51636,L51636,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Welcome.
"
L51635,L51635,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Thanks, Melvin.
"
L51631,L51631,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
"
L51630,L51630,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
"
L51629,L51629,u3777,m249,CAROL,"It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
"
L51628,L51628,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I was going to do that for you.
"
L51625,L51625,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
"
L51624,L51624,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
"
L51623,L51623,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Hi.
"
L51608,L51608,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
"
L51607,L51607,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Whether crabs are in season there now...
"
L51606,L51606,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
"
L51605,L51605,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
"
L51604,L51604,u3777,m249,CAROL,"There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
"
L51603,L51603,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
"
L51602,L51602,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
"
L51601,L51601,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Yes.
"
L51600,L51600,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Are you still coming?
"
L51599,L51599,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Hello?
"
L51595,L51595,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No.
"
L51594,L51594,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Is there another way to see it?
"
L51593,L51593,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
"
L51592,L51592,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
"
L51591,L51591,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
"
L51590,L51590,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What's that got to do with it?
"
L51589,L51589,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Melvin, I'd rather not.
"
L51588,L51588,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
"
L51587,L51587,u3777,m249,CAROL,"My son.
"
L51586,L51586,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You take off when you have to.
"
L51585,L51585,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I can't. I work.
"
L51584,L51584,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Two days.
"
L51583,L51583,u3777,m249,CAROL,"The stiff one eye?
"
L51582,L51582,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
"
L51581,L51581,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No, sir...
"
L51580,L51580,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I want you to go on this trip.
"
L51579,L51579,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, ""what?"" I thought I said, ""what?""... What?
"
L51578,L51578,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Now I want you to do something for me.
"
L51577,L51577,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Thank you.
"
L51576,L51576,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Nice of you... thank you.
"
L51574,L51574,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
"
L51573,L51573,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Lovely.
"
L51572,L51572,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
"
L51571,L51571,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No... no thank you notes.
"
L51570,L51570,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What you did changed my life.
"
L51569,L51569,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hey, what I did for you is working out?
"
L51568,L51568,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Okay.
"
L51567,L51567,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
"
L51566,L51566,u3777,m249,CAROL,"So. Anything else?
"
L51561,L51561,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
"
L51560,L51560,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
"
L51559,L51559,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Getting loud, getting loud.
"
L51543,L51543,u3777,m249,CAROL,"A thank-you note for what you did for me.
"
L51542,L51542,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What's this?
"
L51500,L51500,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Yes.
"
L51499,L51499,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"So you'll be at work?
"
L51498,L51498,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Just how grateful I am.
"
L51497,L51497,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
"
L51496,L51496,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm not kidding.
"
L51494,L51494,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
"
L51493,L51493,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What needs clearing up?
"
L51492,L51492,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
"
L51491,L51491,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
"
L51490,L51490,u3777,m249,CAROL,"But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
"
L51489,L51489,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
"
L51488,L51488,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Why did yo do this for me?
"
L51487,L51487,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Note. Put it in the note.
"
L51486,L51486,u3777,m249,CAROL,"That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
"
L51485,L51485,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
"
L51484,L51484,u3777,m249,CAROL,"The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
"
L51483,L51483,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Yes.
"
L51482,L51482,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Carol the waitress?
"
L51481,L51481,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Uh, Udall?
"
L51368,L51368,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No!!! Stay away from me!
"
L51367,L51367,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
"
L51354,L51354,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"How ya doing?
"
L51353,L51353,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
"
L51352,L51352,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
"
L51351,L51351,u3777,m249,CAROL,"How do you know about my mother?
"
L51350,L51350,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What about your mother?
"
L51349,L51349,u3777,m249,CAROL,"My son is sick, okay?
"
L51348,L51348,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
"
L51347,L51347,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
"
L51346,L51346,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
"
L51345,L51345,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
"
L51344,L51344,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
"
L51343,L51343,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What are you doing here?
"
L51342,L51342,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
"
L51294,L51294,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You all set here?
"
L51293,L51293,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
"
L51290,L51290,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What's with the dark?
"
L51289,L51289,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
"
L51288,L51288,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Otherwise, you're not ugly.
"
L51287,L51287,u3777,m249,CAROL,"And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
"
L51286,L51286,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
"
L51285,L51285,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Oh, please...
"
L51284,L51284,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"How old are you?
"
L51283,L51283,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
"
L51282,L51282,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It's okay -- I'll sit here.
"
L51281,L51281,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Sorry.
"
L51280,L51280,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
"
L51279,L51279,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You're not worried that someone might take him?
"
L51278,L51278,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
"
L51277,L51277,u3777,m249,CAROL,"So what are you doing with a dog?
"
L51226,L51226,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Spence.
"
L51225,L51225,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay.
"
L51224,L51224,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Spencer.
"
L51223,L51223,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"His name?
"
L51222,L51222,u3777,m249,CAROL,"An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
"
L51221,L51221,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No.
"
L51220,L51220,u3777,m249,CAROL,"He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
"
L51219,L51219,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What do you care?
"
L51218,L51218,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What's wrong with your son, anyway?
"
L51217,L51217,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Just give yourself a little pep talk. ""Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out.""
"
L51216,L51216,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I see the help -- judgement call.
"
L51215,L51215,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
"
L51214,L51214,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Okay.
"
L51213,L51213,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, ""Thank you."" No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
"
L51168,L51168,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
"
L51167,L51167,u3777,m249,CAROL,"You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
"
L51166,L51166,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
"
L51159,L51159,u3777,m249,CAROL,"It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
"
L51158,L51158,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I've got Jews at my table.
"
L51157,L51157,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I know. He's just the best.
"
L51153,L51153,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Will you please take it?
"
L51152,L51152,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'm starving.
"
L51815,L51815,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Don't want to. I love you.
"
L51795,L51795,u3777,m249,CAROL,"One night with me!
"
L51791,L51791,u3777,m249,CAROL,"But what about...
"
L51784,L51784,u3777,m249,CAROL,"We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
"
L51777,L51777,u3777,m249,CAROL,"All right, cut me a break.
"
L51775,L51775,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
"
L51773,L51773,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Stop staring. Do a vase.
"
L51771,L51771,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
"
L51768,L51768,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Good night.
"
L51766,L51766,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
"
L51764,L51764,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Why? What have you been thinking about?
"
L51762,L51762,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm sorry... are you okay?
"
L51760,L51760,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
"
L51758,L51758,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
"
L51756,L51756,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
"
L51680,L51680,u3777,m249,CAROL,"What a nice compliment.
"
L51678,L51678,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
"
L51649,L51649,u3777,m249,CAROL,"No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
"
L51647,L51647,u3777,m249,CAROL,"Yes. I really would.
"
L51640,L51640,u3777,m249,CAROL,"I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
"
L51335,L51335,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
"
L51333,L51333,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What are you trying to do to me?
"
L51331,L51331,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No. No. Get Carol.
"
L51327,L51327,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
"
L51324,L51324,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You changed the room around...
"
L51322,L51322,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
"
L51320,L51320,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as ""obsessive compulsive disorder"" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
"
L51318,L51318,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Help!
"
L51565,L51565,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Last word freak.
"
L51563,L51563,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
"
L51558,L51558,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
"
L51556,L51556,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Think white and get serious.
"
L51554,L51554,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
"
L51552,L51552,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
"
L51550,L51550,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"About a dog.
"
L51548,L51548,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"""What?"" Look at you... You sense a mark.
"
L51545,L51545,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
"
L51539,L51539,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
"
L51537,L51537,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
"
L51307,L51307,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay by me.
"
L51305,L51305,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
"
L51303,L51303,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"He's a pain in the ass.
"
L51254,L51254,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.
"
L51252,L51252,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'm not saying nothing to you.
"
L51139,L51139,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
"
L51137,L51137,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No touch. No touch. No touch.
"
L51104,L51104,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hope you find him. I love that dog.
"
L51101,L51101,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
"
L51709,L51709,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
"
L51696,L51696,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Wait here.
"
L51691,L51691,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What?
"
L51687,L51687,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hi. You have hard shells, right?
"
L51447,L51447,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City ""Sailor want to hump-hump bar""? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
"
L51445,L51445,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Sure thing.
"
L51443,L51443,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Absolutely.
"
L51441,L51441,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Is he dead yet?
"
L51244,L51244,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Ask him.
"
L51242,L51242,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Just move on. No one here killed him.
"
L51240,L51240,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
"
L51873,L51873,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I forgot to lock the door.
"
L51871,L51871,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
"
L51869,L51869,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
"
L51867,L51867,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Absolutely not.
"
L51865,L51865,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
"
L51863,L51863,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
"
L51861,L51861,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
"
L51859,L51859,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
"
L51857,L51857,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I'm a great guy -- ""extraordinary""...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
"
L51854,L51854,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"You going to come talk to me or not?
"
L51831,L51831,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Look, we both want the dog -- and...
"
L51825,L51825,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
"
L51819,L51819,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I think you gotta camp it here...
"
L51817,L51817,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I told you to go on in.
"
L51804,L51804,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Does it matter?
"
L51802,L51802,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
"
L51793,L51793,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What are you talking about? You got real problems.
"
L51789,L51789,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
"
L51787,L51787,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
"
L51674,L51674,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I give you that one...  Nice packing.
"
L51672,L51672,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
"
L51670,L51670,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
"
L51664,L51664,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
"
L51652,L51652,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"This stuff is pointless.
"
L51633,L51633,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Never a break. Never.
"
L51627,L51627,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
"
L51509,L51509,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yeah...
"
L51507,L51507,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
"
L51505,L51505,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
"
L51503,L51503,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I brought you Chinese soup.
"
L51479,L51479,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
"
L51477,L51477,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yo, yo, yo...
"
L51475,L51475,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Now we'll both call him.
"
L51473,L51473,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I carry bacon in my pocket.
"
L51472,L51472,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
"
L51470,L51470,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
"
L51467,L51467,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
"
L51465,L51465,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
"
L51462,L51462,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Where are all your queer party friends?
"
L51460,L51460,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"That cleaning woman doesn't...
"
L51458,L51458,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"It smells like shit in here?
"
L51455,L51455,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
"
L51311,L51311,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
"
L51308,L51308,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
"
L51132,L51132,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Okay, then.
"
L51130,L51130,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
"
L51128,L51128,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
"
L51126,L51126,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Do you realize that I work at him?
"
L51124,L51124,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Well, that's a load off.
"
L51121,L51121,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Yeeeess!!!
"
L51119,L51119,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"'Love was... '
"
L51098,L51098,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"How're you doing?
"
L51096,L51096,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
"
L51094,L51094,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
"
L51092,L51092,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What's he look like?
"
L51391,L51391,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
"
L51388,L51388,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
"
L51386,L51386,u3784,m249,MELVIN,"What's it mean?
"
L370940,L370940,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Waddaya getting so sore about?
"
L370938,L370938,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
"
L370934,L370934,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
"
L370929,L370929,u2010,m130,MARTY,"We just talked.
"
L370927,L370927,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
"
L370920,L370920,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
"
L370918,L370918,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
"
L370912,L370912,u2010,m130,MARTY,"We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
"
L370805,L370805,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Where you going?
"
L370803,L370803,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
"
L370801,L370801,u2010,m130,MARTY,"It must be one o'clock.
"
L370799,L370799,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What for?
"
L370797,L370797,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
"
L370792,L370792,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
"
L370514,L370514,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
"
L370512,L370512,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Yeah, she looks all right from here.
"
L370510,L370510,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Where?
"
L370508,L370508,u2010,m130,MARTY,"There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
"
L370386,L370386,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
"
L370384,L370384,u2010,m130,MARTY,"My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
"
L370382,L370382,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
"
L370379,L370379,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
"
L370377,L370377,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Yeah, sure.
"
L370375,L370375,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What makes you say that?
"
L370373,L370373,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
"
L370371,L370371,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
"
L370369,L370369,u2010,m130,MARTY,"She probably got a date by now, Angie.
"
L370367,L370367,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, yeah.
"
L370365,L370365,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Which one was that?
"
L370363,L370363,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
"
L370905,L370905,u2010,m130,MARTY,"She wasn't so bad.
"
L370903,L370903,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Who told you that?
"
L370901,L370901,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
"
L370388,L370388,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
"
L370813,L370813,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Okay.
"
L370812,L370812,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
"
L370810,L370810,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Okay.
"
L370809,L370809,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So I'll call you tomorrow.
"
L370808,L370808,u2004,m130,CLARA,"We just live one flight up.
"
L370807,L370807,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You got an elevator in this house?
"
L370795,L370795,u2004,m130,CLARA,"How do you do?
"
L370794,L370794,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
"
L370754,L370754,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Nothing.
"
L370753,L370753,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
"
L370751,L370751,u2004,m130,CLARA,"All right.
"
L370750,L370750,u2010,m130,MARTY,"We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
"
L370749,L370749,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I'll wait for your call.
"
L370748,L370748,u2010,m130,MARTY,"The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
"
L370747,L370747,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I'd like that very much.
"
L370746,L370746,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
"
L370745,L370745,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Nothing.
"
L370744,L370744,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
"
L370738,L370738,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Marty...
"
L370737,L370737,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Please...
"
L370736,L370736,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No...
"
L370735,L370735,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Please...
"
L370734,L370734,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No...
"
L370733,L370733,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I just wanna kiss, that's all.
"
L370732,L370732,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Marty...
"
L370731,L370731,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
"
L370730,L370730,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, Marty, please...
"
L370729,L370729,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Maybe that would be a good idea.
"
L370728,L370728,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
"
L370727,L370727,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Oh, I'm fine.
"
L370726,L370726,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
"
L370725,L370725,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
"
L370724,L370724,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
"
L370723,L370723,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
"
L370722,L370722,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Come on inna dining room.
"
L370721,L370721,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Yes, I know.
"
L370720,L370720,u2010,m130,MARTY,"This is the kitchen.
"
L370690,L370690,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
"
L370689,L370689,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Actually, I don't make friends easily.
"
L370688,L370688,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
"
L370687,L370687,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I'm afraid of being lonely.
"
L370686,L370686,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. ""My mother needs me."" But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
"
L370685,L370685,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
"
L370684,L370684,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
"
L370683,L370683,u2004,m130,CLARA,"...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
"
L370657,L370657,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
"
L370656,L370656,u2010,m130,MARTY,"It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
"
L370655,L370655,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I really should get home...
"
L370654,L370654,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
"
L370651,L370651,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
"
L370650,L370650,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Wadda you think?
"
L370646,L370646,u2010,m130,MARTY,"That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
"
L370645,L370645,u2004,m130,CLARA,"It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
"
L370644,L370644,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
"
L370643,L370643,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I don't.
"
L370642,L370642,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
"
L370641,L370641,u2004,m130,CLARA,"There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
"
L370640,L370640,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
"
L370639,L370639,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Yes, I know.
"
L370638,L370638,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
"
L370637,L370637,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Yes, I know.
"
L370636,L370636,u2010,m130,MARTY,"...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
"
L370626,L370626,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Thank you.
"
L370625,L370625,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
"
L370615,L370615,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
"
L370614,L370614,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Benjamin Franklin High School.
"
L370613,L370613,u2010,m130,MARTY,"...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
"
L370612,L370612,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm thirty-four.
"
L370611,L370611,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
"
L370609,L370609,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
"
L370608,L370608,u2004,m130,CLARA,"You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
"
L370607,L370607,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
"
L370606,L370606,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I'm having a very good time, too.
"
L370605,L370605,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
"
L370604,L370604,u2004,m130,CLARA,"This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
"
L370603,L370603,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
"
L370602,L370602,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
"
L370601,L370601,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Yeah.
"
L370600,L370600,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
"
L370599,L370599,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You come up here often?
"
L370785,L370785,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
"
L370781,L370781,u2004,m130,CLARA,"It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
"
L370778,L370778,u2004,m130,CLARA,"It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
"
L370776,L370776,u2004,m130,CLARA,"I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
"
L370774,L370774,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
"
L370772,L370772,u2004,m130,CLARA,"You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
"
L370770,L370770,u2004,m130,CLARA,"Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
"
L370768,L370768,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
"
L370759,L370759,u2004,m130,CLARA,"No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
"
L370529,L370529,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
"
L370527,L370527,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Are you kidding?
"
L370525,L370525,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What?
"
L370523,L370523,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm stag.
"
L370521,L370521,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You say something?
"
L370862,L370862,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Sure. This girl said...
"
L370860,L370860,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
"
L370857,L370857,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
"
L370854,L370854,u2010,m130,MARTY,"No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
"
L370852,L370852,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
"
L370837,L370837,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
"
L370446,L370446,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Don't worry about it.
"
L370444,L370444,u2010,m130,MARTY,"All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
"
L370441,L370441,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
"
L370439,L370439,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
"
L370948,L370948,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
"
L370899,L370899,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
"
L370897,L370897,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What didn't you like about her?
"
L370895,L370895,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
"
L370892,L370892,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
"
L370890,L370890,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know. I don't think so.
"
L370887,L370887,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What, Ma?
"
L370885,L370885,u2010,m130,MARTY,"She's twenty-nine, Ma.
"
L370883,L370883,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I heard you, Ma.
"
L370878,L370878,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
"
L370783,L370783,u2010,m130,MARTY,"All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
"
L370779,L370779,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
"
L370767,L370767,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
"
L370765,L370765,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
"
L370763,L370763,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
"
L370761,L370761,u2010,m130,MARTY,"How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
"
L370757,L370757,u2010,m130,MARTY,"We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
"
L370476,L370476,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma! Leave me alone!
"
L370474,L370474,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
"
L370472,L370472,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
"
L370470,L370470,u2010,m130,MARTY,"So I'll die without a son.
"
L370468,L370468,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
"
L370466,L370466,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
"
L370464,L370464,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
"
L370462,L370462,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
"
L370460,L370460,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
"
L370458,L370458,u2010,m130,MARTY,"It's loaded with what?
"
L370456,L370456,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What?
"
L370454,L370454,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
"
L370429,L370429,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
"
L370425,L370425,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
"
L370423,L370423,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ma.
"
L370390,L370390,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
"
L370906,L370906,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
"
L370711,L370711,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
"
L370709,L370709,u2010,m130,MARTY,"I'm with a girl, Ralph.
"
L370706,L370706,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hiya.

L370704,L370704,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Waddaya mean, Ralph?
"
L370694,L370694,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hello, Ralph.
"
L370358,L370358,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
"
L370356,L370356,u2010,m130,MARTY,"What nurses?
"
L370349,L370349,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Waddaya read there, Joe?
"
L370347,L370347,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
"
L370345,L370345,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hiya, Ralph...
"
L370343,L370343,u2010,m130,MARTY,"You want a beer, Ang'?
"
L370341,L370341,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Hey, Ang'...
"
L370331,L370331,u2010,m130,MARTY,"That's swell, Missus Fusari.
"
L370329,L370329,u2010,m130,MARTY,"Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
"
L370324,L370324,u2010,m130,MARTY,"No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
"
L370322,L370322,u2010,m130,MARTY,"No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
"
L370320,L370320,u2010,m130,MARTY,"That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
"
L58965,L58965,u3820,m252,LANDON,"And I have no idea why.
"
L58963,L58963,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm sorry about how we --
"
L58960,L58960,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'll tell her you were here.
"
L58514,L58514,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
"
L58508,L58508,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Heart be still.
"
L58238,L58238,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I. Don't. Dance.
"
L58236,L58236,u3820,m252,LANDON,"So go dance.
"
L59006,L59006,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
"
L58992,L58992,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Now it's okay?
"
L58990,L58990,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What are you doing here?
"
L58893,L58893,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
"
L58883,L58883,u3820,m252,LANDON,"It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
"
L58881,L58881,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I told him to leave me alone.
"
L58879,L58879,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I didn't know either.
"
L58811,L58811,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
"
L58809,L58809,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
"
L58806,L58806,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
"
L58804,L58804,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I meant he's a doctor.
"
L58802,L58802,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I could take after Dad, too.
"
L58798,L58798,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yeah.
"
L58796,L58796,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Late night.  You?
"
L58630,L58630,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No. I won't be long.
"
L58627,L58627,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Me neither.
"
L58625,L58625,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Thanks.
"
L58623,L58623,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're fine like that, Mom.
"
L58608,L58608,u3820,m252,LANDON,"He wants to show now.
"
L58606,L58606,u3820,m252,LANDON,"We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
"
L58603,L58603,u3820,m252,LANDON,"That's over. Way over.
"
L58341,L58341,u3820,m252,LANDON,"-- I like the car I have.
"
L58339,L58339,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I don't want his money.
"
L58303,L58303,u3820,m252,LANDON,"'Bout what?
"
L58301,L58301,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
"
L58285,L58285,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Cuz nothing happened at school.
"
L58283,L58283,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Kelly wouldn't do that.
"
L58929,L58929,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
"
L58577,L58577,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Later.
"
L58567,L58567,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Scamming's a strong word.
"
L58565,L58565,u3820,m252,LANDON,"It was.
"
L58561,L58561,u3820,m252,LANDON,"She's not. She's got her own ideas.
"
L58506,L58506,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Demented.
"
L58276,L58276,u3820,m252,LANDON,"The address?!
"
L58273,L58273,u3820,m252,LANDON,"And you don't.  What's she doing in there?
"
L58271,L58271,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Don't call him a dipshit.
"
L58252,L58252,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Hypotheticals --
"
L58248,L58248,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm thinking.
"
L58233,L58233,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
"
L58655,L58655,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
"
L58650,L58650,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm very sorry --
"
L58649,L58649,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Me.
"
L58647,L58647,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
"
L59036,L59036,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Yes.
"
L59035,L59035,u3820,m252,LANDON,"But if you could, you would?
"
L59034,L59034,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Landon. I can't even do for myself.
"
L59033,L59033,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Will you do something for me?
"
L59027,L59027,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You'll be fine for a few minutes.
"
L59026,L59026,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Can I -- go out?
"
L58984,L58984,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
"
L58983,L58983,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'll talk to your father.
"
L58980,L58980,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"No.  Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.  Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
"
L58979,L58979,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Because you have hope that you'll get better?
"
L58978,L58978,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's gone now.
"
L58977,L58977,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Better. I was really angry.
"
L58976,L58976,u3820,m252,LANDON,"How're you doing?
"
L58975,L58975,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That was read at my parents' wedding.
"
L58974,L58974,u3820,m252,LANDON,"'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '

"
L58938,L58938,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I was going to fake it.
"
L58937,L58937,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You know how to waltz??
"
L58925,L58925,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm not going back to school.
"
L58924,L58924,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
"
L58921,L58921,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That's what I mean.
"
L58920,L58920,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I've talked to your father.
"
L58918,L58918,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I don't want to come here anymore.
"
L58917,L58917,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Now? We just --
"
L58916,L58916,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That I want you to take me home.
"
L58915,L58915,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What are you thinking?
"
L58911,L58911,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I used to like yogurt.
"
L58910,L58910,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
"
L58909,L58909,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Nothing.
"
L58908,L58908,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Anything you want.
"
L58907,L58907,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Nope.
"
L58905,L58905,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I will.
"
L58904,L58904,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Help me live until I die?
"
L58902,L58902,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
"
L58901,L58901,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Are you frightened?
"
L58900,L58900,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
"
L58899,L58899,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
"
L58898,L58898,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I should have told you sooner --
"
L58897,L58897,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
"
L58856,L58856,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
"
L58855,L58855,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Why didn't you tell me?
"
L58852,L58852,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
"
L58851,L58851,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm sick.
"
L58850,L58850,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Jamie --
"
L58849,L58849,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Where? Why?
"
L58848,L58848,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Pull over.
"
L58847,L58847,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What are you going to -- ?
"
L58846,L58846,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"No.
"
L58845,L58845,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
"
L58843,L58843,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm not applying to college.
"
L58842,L58842,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're worried about your college applications.
"
L58841,L58841,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Yes, one of many.
"
L58840,L58840,u3820,m252,LANDON,"One of your secrets.
"
L58839,L58839,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Yes. I try to keep my power.
"
L58838,L58838,u3820,m252,LANDON,"That what you do?
"
L58837,L58837,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
"
L58836,L58836,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I don't care.
"
L58835,L58835,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"From citizen high to citizen low.
"
L58791,L58791,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
"
L58790,L58790,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Here. Why am I looking at this star?
"
L58789,L58789,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Sure.
"
L58788,L58788,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Can you locate XXI5639I?
"
L58786,L58786,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Me.
"
L58785,L58785,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What's the best thing I can see tonight?
"
L58783,L58783,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
"
L58782,L58782,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What about your father?
"
L58781,L58781,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Ergo?
"
L58778,L58778,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No. Why? Are you seducible?
"
L58777,L58777,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Are you trying to seduce me?
"
L58776,L58776,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Hoped for it.
"
L58775,L58775,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You planned this --
"
L58774,L58774,u3820,m252,LANDON,"A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
"
L58773,L58773,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
"
L58772,L58772,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Mars.
"
L58771,L58771,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"So what do you want to see?
"
L58769,L58769,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
"
L58768,L58768,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Where's the one you're building?
"
L58767,L58767,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
"
L58765,L58765,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I was twelve.
"
L58764,L58764,u3820,m252,LANDON,"When did you build this?
"
L58763,L58763,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"The truth. I just left you out of it.
"
L58762,L58762,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What'd you tell your father?
"
L58761,L58761,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Look. Talk. Not talk.
"
L58760,L58760,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"What would you do up here?
"
L58759,L58759,u3820,m252,LANDON,"From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
"
L58758,L58758,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
"
L58757,L58757,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"How do you know this place?
"
L58756,L58756,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Away from here.
"
L58755,L58755,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Where?
"
L58754,L58754,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Come on.
"
L58753,L58753,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
"
L58752,L58752,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What's wr--?
"
L58751,L58751,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Twice a year.
"
L58750,L58750,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Assholes. This happen to you?
"
L58745,L58745,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That. And less strange.
"
L58744,L58744,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Loved?
"
L58743,L58743,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You make me feel...
"
L58740,L58740,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Not possible.
"
L58739,L58739,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I might do it wrong.
"
L58737,L58737,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Maybe you're not supposed to.
"
L58736,L58736,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I don't understand...
"
L58735,L58735,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
"
L58734,L58734,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What do you actually know with religion?
"
L58733,L58733,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
"
L58732,L58732,u3820,m252,LANDON,"We can measure wind.
"
L58730,L58730,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm sure. Pretty sure.
"
L58729,L58729,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're sometimes not sure?
"
L58728,L58728,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
"
L58725,L58725,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
"
L58724,L58724,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You're acting like a crazy person.
"
L58723,L58723,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Where?
"
L58722,L58722,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Stand right here.
"
L58719,L58719,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That what's happening to you, only faster?
"
L58718,L58718,u3820,m252,LANDON,"The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
"
L58715,L58715,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Fun.
"
L58714,L58714,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Excuse me?
"
L58713,L58713,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"What are you talking about?
"
L58712,L58712,u3820,m252,LANDON,"It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
"
L58711,L58711,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
"
L58710,L58710,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"We're doing something -- ?
"
L58709,L58709,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Before we do this.
"
L58707,L58707,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I know you want to.
"
L58706,L58706,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"No.
"
L58705,L58705,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Your turn.
"
L58704,L58704,u3820,m252,LANDON,"We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
"
L58703,L58703,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's only 7:30.
"
L58702,L58702,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I have to get you home by one.
"
L58701,L58701,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Is there a rush?
"
L58700,L58700,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I wanted this to be a date.
"
L58699,L58699,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
"
L58678,L58678,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm not allowed to date.
"
L58677,L58677,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Why not?
"
L58676,L58676,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Yes. But not as a date date.
"
L58675,L58675,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You.
"
L58674,L58674,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What?
"
L58673,L58673,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Like fire.
"
L58672,L58672,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No.  But are you -- impressed?
"
L58671,L58671,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
"
L58670,L58670,u3820,m252,LANDON,"She great or what?
"
L58669,L58669,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I heard what you did. Thank you.
"
L58668,L58668,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Hey.
"
L58621,L58621,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It means you can do anything.
"
L58620,L58620,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What does that mean?!
"
L58617,L58617,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"When I have something to say.
"
L58616,L58616,u3820,m252,LANDON,"So you're talking to me?
"
L58615,L58615,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
"
L58614,L58614,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's a start.
"
L58599,L58599,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
"
L58598,L58598,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"And why would that scare me?
"
L58597,L58597,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
"
L58596,L58596,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You don't know what you want --
"
L58595,L58595,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I don't want to be just your friend --
"
L58594,L58594,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
"
L58593,L58593,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
"
L58590,L58590,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Prove it.
"
L58589,L58589,u3820,m252,LANDON,"It's not.
"
L58588,L58588,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"All of it.
"
L58587,L58587,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That sounds like horseshit.
"
L58586,L58586,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Maybe you inspire me.
"
L58579,L58579,u3820,m252,LANDON,"And that would ruin your reputation how?
"
L58578,L58578,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"People can see.
"
L58574,L58574,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You're hardly nice to anyone.
"
L58573,L58573,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I haven't been nice to you.
"
L58572,L58572,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Thank you. So were you.
"
L58571,L58571,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You were great the other night.
"
L58570,L58570,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Healthy as can be.
"
L58569,L58569,u3820,m252,LANDON,"He okay?
"
L58528,L58528,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Then maybe you can read mine.
"
L58527,L58527,u3820,m252,LANDON,"That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
"
L58526,L58526,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"So it's like you want to be secret friends.
"
L58525,L58525,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That would be the reason.
"
L58524,L58524,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Belinda's a very jealous person.
"
L58523,L58523,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Or anywhere where people might see us.
"
L58522,L58522,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yeah --
"
L58521,L58521,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Oh. Just not at school...
"
L58520,L58520,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Yes. And?
"
L58519,L58519,u3820,m252,LANDON,"The play's in a couple of weeks.
"
L58518,L58518,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You don't miss a thing.
"
L58517,L58517,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're not in a very good mood.
"
L58511,L58511,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm really glad you think so.
"
L58510,L58510,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"The play's going to be really good.
"
L58496,L58496,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Sometimes I don't even trust me.
"
L58495,L58495,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"He doesn't trust you.
"
L58494,L58494,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Your father doesn't like me.
"
L58493,L58493,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Interpreted by another guy like my father.
"
L58492,L58492,u3820,m252,LANDON,"The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
"
L58491,L58491,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You don't believe in anything?
"
L58490,L58490,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You have to believe to have faith.
"
L58489,L58489,u3820,m252,LANDON,"There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
"
L58488,L58488,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
"
L58487,L58487,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No.
"
L58486,L58486,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
"
L58485,L58485,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
"
L58483,L58483,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Don't you?
"
L58482,L58482,u3820,m252,LANDON,"But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
"
L58481,L58481,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"My relationship with God is my own.
"
L58480,L58480,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yeah.
"
L58479,L58479,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"In ten words or less?
"
L58478,L58478,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're really into God, right?
"
L58477,L58477,u3820,m252,LANDON,"In 76 years, me neither.
"
L58476,L58476,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
"
L58475,L58475,u3820,m252,LANDON,"The dirty snowball at its core.
"
L58474,L58474,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
"
L58473,L58473,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
"
L58472,L58472,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
"
L58471,L58471,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Looking for something -- someone.
"
L58470,L58470,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Looking for intelligent life?
"
L58468,L58468,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
"
L58467,L58467,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
"
L58466,L58466,u3820,m252,LANDON,"But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
"
L58465,L58465,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
"
L58464,L58464,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Saturn. Beautiful.
"
L58463,L58463,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"That is my telescope.
"
L58462,L58462,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What is that?
"
L58460,L58460,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Could be...
"
L58459,L58459,u3820,m252,LANDON,"The world of the dead?
"
L58458,L58458,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
"
L58455,L58455,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Do you think I'm strange?
"
L58454,L58454,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
"
L58453,L58453,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Because I try to be nice to people?
"
L58450,L58450,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Know so.
"
L58449,L58449,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You think so.
"
L58448,L58448,u3820,m252,LANDON,"He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
"
L58447,L58447,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I know. Don't say anything.
"
L58433,L58433,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Don't bother!
"
L58432,L58432,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'll get something for us to drink --
"
L58426,L58426,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"And you have to meet my father.
"
L58425,L58425,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No problem --
"
L58422,L58422,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
"
L58421,L58421,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Like you'd know.
"
L58420,L58420,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Ambitious.
"
L58419,L58419,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
"
L58418,L58418,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
"
L58417,L58417,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You want to tell me...
"
L58416,L58416,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's private.
"
L58415,L58415,u3820,m252,LANDON,"So what else is on this list?
"
L58413,L58413,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
"
L58412,L58412,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Go for it.
"
L58411,L58411,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'll take a chance.
"
L58410,L58410,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Maybe a little of both.
"
L58409,L58409,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
"
L58408,L58408,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You got some kind of list?
"
L58407,L58407,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Good thing.
"
L58406,L58406,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
"
L58405,L58405,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Kinda. Yeah.
"
L58404,L58404,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm an enemy?
"
L58403,L58403,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
"
L58402,L58402,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What's with the friggin numbers?
"
L58398,L58398,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"So you agree you need help?
"
L58397,L58397,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What the -- ?!
"
L58396,L58396,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No. Not like you.
"
L58395,L58395,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Like me.
"
L58394,L58394,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
"
L58393,L58393,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Because that's where the fire is?
"
L58392,L58392,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Why?
"
L58391,L58391,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yeah.
"
L58390,L58390,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
"
L58389,L58389,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I know you don't want help.
"
L58386,L58386,u3820,m252,LANDON,"My act?!
"
L58385,L58385,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"-- Your act only works with an audience.
"
L58384,L58384,u3820,m252,LANDON,"That's deep --
"
L58381,L58381,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"-- I know you don't suck at acting.
"
L58380,L58380,u3820,m252,LANDON,"This play -- ?
"
L58379,L58379,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"-- This play means a lot to me.
"
L58378,L58378,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
"
L58373,L58373,u3820,m252,LANDON,"'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
"
L58372,L58372,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"'Is it really me?'
"
L58368,L58368,u3820,m252,LANDON,"'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
"
L58367,L58367,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"'They won't.'
"
L58366,L58366,u3820,m252,LANDON,"'I hope your dreams come true.'
"
L58360,L58360,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
"
L58359,L58359,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I don't want to have any conversation.
"
L58358,L58358,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Can't you have a normal conversation?
"
L58357,L58357,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
"
L58356,L58356,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
"
L58355,L58355,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
"
L58354,L58354,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
"
L58353,L58353,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"You don't know me.
"
L58352,L58352,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Were?
"
L58351,L58351,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Because, growing up, books were my world.
"
L58349,L58349,u3820,m252,LANDON,"-- Obviously.
"
L58348,L58348,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I don't make small talk --
"
L58347,L58347,u3820,m252,LANDON,"-- This your idea of small talk?
"
L58346,L58346,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
"
L58950,L58950,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
"
L58890,L58890,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
"
L58888,L58888,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
"
L58886,L58886,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
"
L58831,L58831,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
"
L58829,L58829,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
"
L58827,L58827,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Dad --
"
L58643,L58643,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I have expectations, too.
"
L58641,L58641,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"It was a play.
"
L58639,L58639,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"No.
"
L58635,L58635,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Up to?
"
L58446,L58446,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
"
L58444,L58444,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
"
L58442,L58442,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"I'm supposed to always be alone?
"
L58440,L58440,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"By accident --
"
L58439,L58439,u3819,m252,JAMIE,"He wants help with his lines --
"
L59049,L59049,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
"
L59047,L59047,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yes.
"
L59042,L59042,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yes. You?
"
L59020,L59020,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I thought she built it herself.
"
L59018,L59018,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You know about this stuff?
"
L59016,L59016,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
"
L59013,L59013,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
"
L58946,L58946,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm not tired.
"
L58865,L58865,u3820,m252,LANDON,"If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
"
L58863,L58863,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Praying.
"
L58860,L58860,u3820,m252,LANDON,"How -- how long does she have?
"
L58823,L58823,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Materially or spiritually?
"
L58821,L58821,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
"
L58819,L58819,u3820,m252,LANDON,"We didn't tell him any different for years --
"
L58818,L58818,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
"
L58815,L58815,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Like what, sir?
"
L58813,L58813,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No.
"
L58688,L58688,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Ever again.
"
L58685,L58685,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I care for her.
"
L58682,L58682,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
"
L58681,L58681,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Yes, sir.
"
L58679,L58679,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
"
L58435,L58435,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
"
L58430,L58430,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Lead man.
"
L58697,L58697,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Thank you.
"
L58694,L58694,u3820,m252,LANDON,"You came here to give me my report card?
"
L58666,L58666,u3820,m252,LANDON,"It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
"
L58664,L58664,u3820,m252,LANDON,"For Jefferson High. For books.
"
L58375,L58375,u3820,m252,LANDON,"No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
"
L58328,L58328,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Then you remember more than I do.
"
L58325,L58325,u3820,m252,LANDON,"When do I get time for me?
"
L58323,L58323,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'd work backstage or something?
"
L58321,L58321,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm as underprivileged as they are --
"
L58319,L58319,u3820,m252,LANDON,"For pay?
"
L58317,L58317,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Please.
"
L58314,L58314,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'd do that --
"
L58311,L58311,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I want to come back.
"
L58296,L58296,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Now I can do what I want.
"
L58289,L58289,u3820,m252,LANDON,"I'm no dummy.
"
L58539,L58539,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Okay. Make me an isosceles.
"
L58537,L58537,u3820,m252,LANDON,"What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
"
L58535,L58535,u3820,m252,LANDON,"So what did we just make?
"
L58534,L58534,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Are you?
"
L58532,L58532,u3820,m252,LANDON,"Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
"
L480304,L480304,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
"
L480302,L480302,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You take the microwave?
"
L480298,L480298,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
"
L480296,L480296,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You don't love me, is that it?
"
L480294,L480294,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Is there somebody else?
"
L480852,L480852,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
"
L480850,L480850,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"But it's on the water.
"
L480848,L480848,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
"
L480846,L480846,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
"
L480844,L480844,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I hate boats.
"
L480842,L480842,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
"
L481180,L481180,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Look!
"
L481178,L481178,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh!
"
L481176,L481176,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You okay?
"
L481174,L481174,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
"
L481172,L481172,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
"
L481170,L481170,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I told you.  Nothing --
"
L481168,L481168,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
"
L481166,L481166,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
"
L481148,L481148,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
"
L481088,L481088,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
"
L481086,L481086,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Walter.
"
L481081,L481081,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I do.
"
L481079,L481079,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
"
L481075,L481075,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
"
L481073,L481073,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"About forever.
"
L481071,L481071,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
"
L481069,L481069,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You go.
"
L480936,L480936,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"And then I'll see you in New York --
"
L480934,L480934,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
"
L480913,L480913,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
"
L480911,L480911,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
"
L480903,L480903,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
"
L480886,L480886,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
"
L480642,L480642,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't think so.
"
L480640,L480640,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's delicious, trust me.
"
L480638,L480638,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
"
L480636,L480636,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Go for a walk in Central Park --
"
L480634,L480634,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Walter, I'd love to --
"
L480632,L480632,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Happy New Year.
"
L480426,L480426,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
"
L480424,L480424,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
"
L480421,L480421,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Even when you were young?
"
L480419,L480419,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
"
L480417,L480417,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
"
L480382,L480382,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Is that all right with you?
"
L480363,L480363,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
"
L480360,L480360,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
"
L480347,L480347,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"They're going to love you.
"
L480345,L480345,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
"
L480343,L480343,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
"
L480341,L480341,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
"
L480339,L480339,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"-- who's married to --
"
L481052,L481052,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is history.
"
L481050,L481050,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
"
L481048,L481048,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No, I'm not. 
"
L481015,L481015,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
"
L481013,L481013,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
"
L481010,L481010,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Made for each other.
"
L481008,L481008,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle.""
"
L481006,L481006,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Becky?
"
L481005,L481005,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
"
L481003,L481003,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I saw her.  She looked just like this --
"
L481001,L481001,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
"
L480996,L480996,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"He said hello.
"
L480994,L480994,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
"
L480992,L480992,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
"
L480984,L480984,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Good night.
"
L480982,L480982,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Thank you.  I love you.
"
L480980,L480980,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Is this crazy?
"
L480978,L480978,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Becky?
"
L480976,L480976,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
"
L480974,L480974,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
"
L480921,L480921,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Definitely.
"
L480919,L480919,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
"
L480883,L480883,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"What?
"
L480881,L480881,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Hello.
"
L480764,L480764,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I always wondered about that too.
"
L480762,L480762,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know.
"
L480760,L480760,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Listen to this, I love this part --
"
L480758,L480758,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
"
L480756,L480756,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No.
"
L480754,L480754,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That's impossible.  A guy can't --
"
L480752,L480752,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
"
L480750,L480750,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
"
L480748,L480748,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""I want to meet you...""
"
L480746,L480746,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
"
L480744,L480744,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I should say something in this about magic.
"
L480742,L480742,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
"
L480740,L480740,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know that.  You think I don't know that? ""I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind.""
"
L480738,L480738,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows"" --
"
L480736,L480736,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"""Dear Sleepless and Son...""
"
L480734,L480734,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
"
L480588,L480588,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Not.
"
L480586,L480586,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Actually, he sounded nice.
"
L480584,L480584,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
"
L480582,L480582,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Nothing's with me.
"
L480580,L480580,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"What was what?
"
L480571,L480571,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
"
L480564,L480564,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"About what?
"
L480797,L480797,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
"
L480795,L480795,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
"
L480793,L480793,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
"
L480791,L480791,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"No, I know that part --
"
L480789,L480789,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
"
L480787,L480787,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
"
L480320,L480320,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
"
L480318,L480318,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I want my money.
"
L480316,L480316,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know. 
"
L480314,L480314,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know.
"
L481212,L481212,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Howard.
"
L481210,L481210,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
"
L481206,L481206,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Yes.
"
L480898,L480898,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Come on, Jonah --
"
L480888,L480888,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"How am I going to explain this to Walter?
"
L480477,L480477,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
"
L480452,L480452,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
"
L480699,L480699,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
"
L480697,L480697,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
"
L480695,L480695,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
"
L480693,L480693,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
"
L480691,L480691,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
"
L480689,L480689,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
"
L480415,L480415,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's a sign.
"
L480413,L480413,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Like... clockwork.
"
L480411,L480411,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Mom, we already...
"
L480409,L480409,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Mom!
"
L480407,L480407,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Magic.
"
L480405,L480405,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"What?
"
L480403,L480403,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"What?
"
L480401,L480401,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
"
L480399,L480399,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
"
L480397,L480397,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
"
L480395,L480395,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
"
L480393,L480393,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
"
L480391,L480391,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
"
L480389,L480389,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
"
L480357,L480357,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's probably just the flowers --
"
L480349,L480349,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Walter and I are engaged!
"
L481204,L481204,u7384,m499,SAM,"The one in the street.  I chased after you.
"
L481203,L481203,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"It's me?
"
L481202,L481202,u7384,m499,SAM,"It's you.
"
L481046,L481046,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Shhhh --
"
L481045,L481045,u7384,m499,SAM,"Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
"
L481044,L481044,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Hi.
"
L480989,L480989,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Hello.
"
L480988,L480988,u7384,m499,SAM,"Hello.
"
L480524,L480524,u7384,m499,SAM,"Magic.
"
L480523,L480523,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Magic.
"
L480522,L480522,u7384,m499,SAM,"You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
"
L480487,L480487,u7384,m499,SAM,"Sure you do --
"
L480486,L480486,u7372,m499,ANNIE,"Sure you do.
"
L480609,L480609,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
"
L480599,L480599,u7384,m499,SAM,"Why me? What about Jay?
"
L480597,L480597,u7384,m499,SAM,"Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
"
L480595,L480595,u7384,m499,SAM,"Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
"
L480592,L480592,u7384,m499,SAM,"The cabinets have to be redone --
"
L480521,L480521,u7384,m499,SAM,"And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
"
L480519,L480519,u7384,m499,SAM,"I don't think I could really describe it.
"
L480517,L480517,u7384,m499,SAM,"I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just <u>knew</u>.
"
L480515,L480515,u7384,m499,SAM,"It's hard to imagine.
"
L480499,L480499,u7384,m499,SAM,"What's she talking about?
"
L480484,L480484,u7384,m499,SAM,"Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
"
L480482,L480482,u7384,m499,SAM,"No.
"
L480480,L480480,u7384,m499,SAM,"It's been about a year and a half.
"
L480478,L480478,u7384,m499,SAM,"All righ...
"
L480474,L480474,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
"
L480471,L480471,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
"
L480469,L480469,u7384,m499,SAM,"Who is this?
"
L480467,L480467,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
"
L480465,L480465,u7384,m499,SAM,"Hello.
"
L480717,L480717,u7384,m499,SAM,"This is going to be tougher than I thought.
"
L480715,L480715,u7384,m499,SAM,"Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
"
L480713,L480713,u7384,m499,SAM,"What is it?
"
L480711,L480711,u7384,m499,SAM,"What's tira misu?
"
L480709,L480709,u7384,m499,SAM,"I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
"
L480707,L480707,u7384,m499,SAM,"Seventy... eight.
"
L480704,L480704,u7384,m499,SAM,"You mean, like, ""He has the cutest butt""? Where did I hear that recently?
"
L480702,L480702,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
"
L480601,L480601,u7384,m499,SAM,"Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
"
L481188,L481188,u7384,m499,SAM,"What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
"
L481186,L481186,u7384,m499,SAM,"Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
"
L481164,L481164,u7384,m499,SAM,"I can't believe you flew first class.
"
L481162,L481162,u7384,m499,SAM,"I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
"
L481160,L481160,u7384,m499,SAM,"Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
"
L481158,L481158,u7384,m499,SAM,"When I found you?
"
L481156,L481156,u7384,m499,SAM,"What if I couldn't get to you?
"
L481111,L481111,u7384,m499,SAM,"Goddammit, I am sick of this --
"
L481109,L481109,u7384,m499,SAM,"Get out.
"
L481107,L481107,u7384,m499,SAM,"I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
"
L481105,L481105,u7384,m499,SAM,"Did not.
"
L481103,L481103,u7384,m499,SAM,"This conversation is finished.
"
L481101,L481101,u7384,m499,SAM,"Shut up.
"
L481099,L481099,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
"
L481095,L481095,u7384,m499,SAM,"I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
"
L481094,L481094,u7384,m499,SAM,"Yes.
"
L481092,L481092,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
"
L481090,L481090,u7384,m499,SAM,"Have you seen my wallet?
"
L480963,L480963,u7384,m499,SAM,"I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
"
L480958,L480958,u7384,m499,SAM,"Who is Annie?
"
L480955,L480955,u7384,m499,SAM,"God, she's beautiful.
"
L480953,L480953,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
"
L480951,L480951,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jonah, this isn't fair.  You don't know Victoria.  I hardly know her myself.  She is, in fact, a mystery to me.  She tosses her hair a lot.  Why does she do this? I have no idea.  Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit.  But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
"
L480930,L480930,u7384,m499,SAM,"This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
"
L480928,L480928,u7384,m499,SAM,"Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
"
L480926,L480926,u7384,m499,SAM,"Everyone at work heard you.
"
L480924,L480924,u7384,m499,SAM,"Did you call that radio station again?
"
L480910,L480910,u7384,m499,SAM,"That's true.  Why is that?
"
L480908,L480908,u7384,m499,SAM,"There's a bathroom upstairs.
"
L480906,L480906,u7384,m499,SAM,"What are you doing up?
"
L480904,L480904,u7384,m499,SAM,"Don't ever do that again.
"
L480880,L480880,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
"
L480878,L480878,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thank Victoria for dinner.
"
L480876,L480876,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jonah!
"
L480874,L480874,u7384,m499,SAM,"Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
"
L480858,L480858,u7384,m499,SAM,"She's going to cook something for us?
"
L480856,L480856,u7384,m499,SAM,"There she is.
"
L480827,L480827,u7384,m499,SAM,"Perfect.  We'll be there.
"
L480825,L480825,u7384,m499,SAM,"Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
"
L480823,L480823,u7384,m499,SAM,"Oh, right.
"
L480821,L480821,u7384,m499,SAM,"Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
"
L480818,L480818,u7384,m499,SAM,"Jonah, I'm leaving --
"
L480816,L480816,u7384,m499,SAM,"Not now, Jonah --
"
L480814,L480814,u7384,m499,SAM,"Now I'm late.  Bye.
"
L480812,L480812,u7384,m499,SAM,"The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
"
L480810,L480810,u7384,m499,SAM,"I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
"
L480804,L480804,u7384,m499,SAM,"This one's for both of us.
"
L480778,L480778,u7384,m499,SAM,"I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
"
L480777,L480777,u7384,m499,SAM,"I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
"
L480775,L480775,u7384,m499,SAM,"I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
"
L480773,L480773,u7384,m499,SAM,"I don't know.
"
L480771,L480771,u7384,m499,SAM,"Is that what she used to sing?
"
L480769,L480769,u7384,m499,SAM,"You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
"
L480767,L480767,u7384,m499,SAM,"What was?
"
L480725,L480725,u7384,m499,SAM,"I know.
"
L480723,L480723,u7384,m499,SAM,"It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
"
L480676,L480676,u7384,m499,SAM,"Go to sleep.
"
L480674,L480674,u7384,m499,SAM,"Whose show was this on?
"
L480672,L480672,u7384,m499,SAM,"What?
"
L480670,L480670,u7384,m499,SAM,"What do you think?
"
L480668,L480668,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm starting to notice that.
"
L480666,L480666,u7384,m499,SAM,"But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
"
L480664,L480664,u7384,m499,SAM,"You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
"
L480662,L480662,u7384,m499,SAM,"This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
"
L480660,L480660,u7384,m499,SAM,"She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
"
L480658,L480658,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
"
L480656,L480656,u7384,m499,SAM,"Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
"
L480654,L480654,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
"
L480651,L480651,u7384,m499,SAM,"How did they get our phone number?
"
L480649,L480649,u7384,m499,SAM,"Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
"
L480626,L480626,u7384,m499,SAM,"Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
"
L480624,L480624,u7384,m499,SAM,"I'm sorry.  I'm just --
"
L480621,L480621,u7384,m499,SAM,"I think I know how to have a spice rack.
"
L480619,L480619,u7384,m499,SAM,"Sure.  Looking good.
"
L480617,L480617,u7384,m499,SAM,"Fine.  Fine.
"
L480615,L480615,u7384,m499,SAM,"Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
"
L480613,L480613,u7384,m499,SAM,"What?
"
L480611,L480611,u7384,m499,SAM,"Does red pepper go under R or P?
"
L480605,L480605,u7384,m499,SAM,"What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
"
L480603,L480603,u7384,m499,SAM,"Oh, you're changing your mind --
"
L480554,L480554,u7384,m499,SAM,"You're right.  You better hope so.
"
L480552,L480552,u7384,m499,SAM,"What?!
"
L480550,L480550,u7384,m499,SAM,"How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
"
L480549,L480549,u7384,m499,SAM,"My feelings exactly.
"
L480537,L480537,u7384,m499,SAM,"It's never happening again. Right?
"
L480534,L480534,u7384,m499,SAM,"We desperately need a spice rack.  Desperately.
"
L480532,L480532,u7384,m499,SAM,"The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
"
L480493,L480493,u7384,m499,SAM,"I don't think I have to now.
"
L480462,L480462,u7384,m499,SAM,"What is it?
"
L480546,L480546,u7384,m499,SAM,"Thanks, but... we've got plans.
"
L480542,L480542,u7384,m499,SAM,"Yes?
"
L480540,L480540,u7384,m499,SAM,"Hi.
"
L481043,L481043,u7384,m499,SAM,"Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
"
L481041,L481041,u7384,m499,SAM,"Anyway, Victoria's nice.
"
L481028,L481028,u7384,m499,SAM,"What do you mean?
"
L481023,L481023,u7384,m499,SAM,"Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
"
L481021,L481021,u7384,m499,SAM,"It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
"
L481017,L481017,u7384,m499,SAM,"I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
"
L480985,L480985,u7384,m499,SAM,"God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
"
L480323,L480323,u7384,m499,SAM,"Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
"
L480301,L480301,u7384,m499,SAM,"Microwave.  Five minutes.
"
L480950,L480950,u7384,m499,SAM,"Sure.  Sure.
"
L480948,L480948,u7384,m499,SAM,"It takes time --
"
L480946,L480946,u7384,m499,SAM,"I read an article about this ...
"
L480944,L480944,u7384,m499,SAM,"He's ten.
"
L480895,L480895,u7384,m499,SAM,"No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
"
L480864,L480864,u7384,m499,SAM,"I've already solved it.  I've hired a hit man.
"
L480862,L480862,u7384,m499,SAM,"We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
"
L480839,L480839,u7384,m499,SAM,"So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
"
L480837,L480837,u7384,m499,SAM,"You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
"
L480835,L480835,u7384,m499,SAM,"You could have called me --
"
L480833,L480833,u7384,m499,SAM,"You did?
"
L480830,L480830,u7384,m499,SAM,"You look good.
"
L480828,L480828,u7384,m499,SAM,"Hi.
"
L445316,L445316,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Dexter.
"
L444925,L444925,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
"
L444923,L444923,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Exactly.
"
L444921,L444921,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
"
L444915,L444915,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
"
L445503,L445503,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
"
L445239,L445239,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
"
L445237,L445237,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
"
L445235,L445235,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Indeed? How interesting.
"
L445528,L445528,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say ""Mr. Stew Smith"" and you'll have to be ""Mrs. Stew Smith"" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
"
L445527,L445527,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You're acting like a child.
"
L445526,L445526,u2495,m161,STEW,"Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
"
L445525,L445525,u2485,m161,ANNE,"That's ridiculous.
"
L445524,L445524,u2495,m161,STEW,"You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
"
L445517,L445517,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You can't walk out of here like this.
"
L445516,L445516,u2495,m161,STEW,"This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
"
L445515,L445515,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Stewart!
"
L445514,L445514,u2495,m161,STEW,"and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
"
L445511,L445511,u2495,m161,STEW,"O-o-oh, I get you  All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
"
L445510,L445510,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Your house?
"
L445509,L445509,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
"
L445508,L445508,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
"
L445507,L445507,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
"
L445506,L445506,u2485,m161,ANNE,"The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
"
L445505,L445505,u2495,m161,STEW,"What's the idea, Anne?
"
L445500,L445500,u2495,m161,STEW,"Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
"
L445499,L445499,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I see.
"
L445498,L445498,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
"
L445496,L445496,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Good morning. What does this mean?
"
L445495,L445495,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
"
L445357,L445357,u2485,m161,ANNE,"That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
"
L445356,L445356,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
"
L445355,L445355,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
"
L445354,L445354,u2495,m161,STEW,"I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
"
L445353,L445353,u2485,m161,ANNE,"But I don't want to meet your gang.
"
L445352,L445352,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
"
L445351,L445351,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
"
L445350,L445350,u2495,m161,STEW,"Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
"
L445349,L445349,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Are you crazy?
"
L445348,L445348,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
"
L445347,L445347,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
"
L445346,L445346,u2495,m161,STEW,"Anne, come here. Listen
"
L445342,L445342,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
"
L445341,L445341,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
"
L445340,L445340,u2495,m161,STEW,"Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
"
L445339,L445339,u2485,m161,ANNE,"What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
"
L445338,L445338,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
"
L445337,L445337,u2485,m161,ANNE,"What are you talking about?
"
L445336,L445336,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm not going!
"
L445335,L445335,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
"
L445334,L445334,u2495,m161,STEW,"I poisoned him.
"
L445333,L445333,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
"
L445312,L445312,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
"
L445311,L445311,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
"
L445243,L445243,u2495,m161,STEW,"You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
"
L445242,L445242,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
"
L445241,L445241,u2495,m161,STEW,"That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
"
L445232,L445232,u2495,m161,STEW,"Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
"
L445231,L445231,u2485,m161,ANNE,"No? What do you look upon her as?
"
L445229,L445229,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Yes - isn't it?
"
L445228,L445228,u2495,m161,STEW,"Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
"
L445227,L445227,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
"
L445226,L445226,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher?
"
L445225,L445225,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
"
L445223,L445223,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
"
L445222,L445222,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
"
L445221,L445221,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
"
L445220,L445220,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Gallagher!
"
L445219,L445219,u2495,m161,STEW,"Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
"
L445151,L445151,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh yes you will wear garters
"
L445150,L445150,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
"
L445149,L445149,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
"
L445148,L445148,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
"
L445147,L445147,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
"
L445146,L445146,u2495,m161,STEW,"Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
"
L445145,L445145,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
"
L445144,L445144,u2495,m161,STEW,"Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
"
L445143,L445143,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I know that.
"
L445142,L445142,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
"
L445141,L445141,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You wear them of course, silly.
"
L445140,L445140,u2495,m161,STEW,"Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
"
L445139,L445139,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Do you like them?
"
L445138,L445138,u2495,m161,STEW,"Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
"
L445137,L445137,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
"
L445087,L445087,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
"
L445086,L445086,u2495,m161,STEW,"Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
"
L445085,L445085,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
"
L445084,L445084,u2495,m161,STEW,"It isn't cheap. It's nice.
"
L445083,L445083,u2485,m161,ANNE,"What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
"
L445082,L445082,u2495,m161,STEW,"Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
"
L445081,L445081,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You have the cutest nose I've
"
L445080,L445080,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now let's get this settled
"
L445079,L445079,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Of course I am Stewart.
"
L445078,L445078,u2495,m161,STEW,"Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
"
L445077,L445077,u2495,m161,STEW,"I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
"
L445076,L445076,u2485,m161,ANNE,"But we don't need it, I'm sure.
"
L445075,L445075,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
"
L445074,L445074,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
"
L445073,L445073,u2495,m161,STEW,"We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
"
L445071,L445071,u2495,m161,STEW,"When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
"
L445070,L445070,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
"
L445069,L445069,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
"
L445068,L445068,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Your place?
"
L445067,L445067,u2495,m161,STEW,"I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
"
L445066,L445066,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
"
L445065,L445065,u2495,m161,STEW,"What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
"
L445061,L445061,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I'm glad.
"
L445060,L445060,u2495,m161,STEW,"A little? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
"
L445050,L445050,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
"
L445049,L445049,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
"
L444940,L444940,u2485,m161,ANNE,"That's because you're too far away, Stew.
"
L444939,L444939,u2495,m161,STEW,"My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
"
L444938,L444938,u2485,m161,ANNE,"None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
"
L444937,L444937,u2495,m161,STEW,"Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
"
L444936,L444936,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
"
L444929,L444929,u2495,m161,STEW,"How-di-do.
"
L444928,L444928,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
"
L444911,L444911,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
"
L444910,L444910,u2495,m161,STEW,"It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
"
L444909,L444909,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, Mother!
"
L444895,L444895,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
"
L444894,L444894,u2495,m161,STEW,"Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
"
L444893,L444893,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
"
L444890,L444890,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You don't wear garters!
"
L444889,L444889,u2495,m161,STEW,"Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
"
L444888,L444888,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
"
L444887,L444887,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
"
L444886,L444886,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Really?
"
L444882,L444882,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
"
L444881,L444881,u2485,m161,ANNE,"won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
"
L444880,L444880,u2495,m161,STEW,"I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
"
L444879,L444879,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
"
L444878,L444878,u2495,m161,STEW,"Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
"
L444877,L444877,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
"
L444875,L444875,u2485,m161,ANNE,"For the letters, of course.
"
L444874,L444874,u2495,m161,STEW,"For what?
"
L444873,L444873,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
"
L444869,L444869,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, I'll take a chance.
"
L444868,L444868,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Will you step into the library?
"
L444867,L444867,u2495,m161,STEW,"So, it's obvious, huh?
"
L444866,L444866,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
"
L444865,L444865,u2495,m161,STEW,"No - give you another guess.
"
L444864,L444864,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I suppose you're going to print them?
"
L444863,L444863,u2495,m161,STEW,"I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
"
L444862,L444862,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Where did you get those letters?
"
L444860,L444860,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
"
L444859,L444859,u2495,m161,STEW,"Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
"
L444858,L444858,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
"
L444857,L444857,u2495,m161,STEW,"Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
"
L444856,L444856,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
"
L444855,L444855,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
"
L444854,L444854,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
"
L444853,L444853,u2485,m161,ANNE,"That's considerate of you.
"
L444852,L444852,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
"
L444851,L444851,u2485,m161,ANNE,"What do you want?
"
L444848,L444848,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You may go, Smythe.
"
L444847,L444847,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
"
L444804,L444804,u2495,m161,STEW,"You're all right.
"
L444803,L444803,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Certainly. Right over there.
"
L444802,L444802,u2495,m161,STEW,"May I use your telephone?
"
L444800,L444800,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
"
L444799,L444799,u2495,m161,STEW,"You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
"
L444793,L444793,u2495,m161,STEW,"No? Why not?
"
L444792,L444792,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
"
L444791,L444791,u2495,m161,STEW,"Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
"
L444790,L444790,u2485,m161,ANNE,"I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
"
L444788,L444788,u2495,m161,STEW,"I don't mind her if you don't.
"
L444787,L444787,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Don't mind Mother.
"
L445319,L445319,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
"
L445290,L445290,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Mother!
"
L445287,L445287,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
"
L445285,L445285,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
"
L445283,L445283,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
"
L445039,L445039,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher
"
L444902,L444902,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Why
"
L444899,L444899,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Oh, hello Mother!
"
L444697,L444697,u2485,m161,ANNE,"Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
"
L444695,L444695,u2485,m161,ANNE,"You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
"
L445445,L445445,u2495,m161,STEW,"You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
"
L445443,L445443,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
"
L445440,L445440,u2495,m161,STEW,"Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
"
L445436,L445436,u2495,m161,STEW,"Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
"
L445276,L445276,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'll bite. What's the catch?
"
L445274,L445274,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah - go on.
"
L445272,L445272,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah?
"
L445269,L445269,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
"
L445267,L445267,u2495,m161,STEW,"Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
"
L445265,L445265,u2495,m161,STEW,"How's that?
"
L445263,L445263,u2495,m161,STEW,"Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
"
L445261,L445261,u2495,m161,STEW,"What do you want?
"
L444719,L444719,u2495,m161,STEW,"Impossible. Put it on again.
"
L444717,L444717,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm afraid.
"
L444715,L444715,u2495,m161,STEW,"Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
"
L445022,L445022,u2495,m161,STEW,"No!
"
L445020,L445020,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm not quitting!
"
L445017,L445017,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure.
"
L445015,L445015,u2495,m161,STEW,"Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
"
L445013,L445013,u2495,m161,STEW,"My play.
"
L445011,L445011,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
"
L445009,L445009,u2495,m161,STEW,"Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
"
L445007,L445007,u2495,m161,STEW,"A what?
"
L444999,L444999,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's so.
"
L444997,L444997,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
"
L444994,L444994,u2495,m161,STEW,"Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
"
L444989,L444989,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
"
L444958,L444958,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, sir.
"
L444956,L444956,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
"
L444954,L444954,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
"
L444951,L444951,u2495,m161,STEW,"Not on my own beat, no.
"
L444949,L444949,u2495,m161,STEW,"It has been alleged - yes
"
L444947,L444947,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
"
L444688,L444688,u2495,m161,STEW,"I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
"
L444686,L444686,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
"
L444684,L444684,u2495,m161,STEW,"Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
"
L444682,L444682,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well - it's only April.
"
L444680,L444680,u2495,m161,STEW,"The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
"
L444678,L444678,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gloria Golden?
"
L444675,L444675,u2495,m161,STEW,"It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
"
L444673,L444673,u2495,m161,STEW,"With me you can always do business.
"
L444670,L444670,u2495,m161,STEW,"You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
"
L444668,L444668,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah.
"
L444666,L444666,u2495,m161,STEW,"Look, I quit!
"
L445131,L445131,u2495,m161,STEW,"A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
"
L445129,L445129,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
"
L445125,L445125,u2495,m161,STEW,"There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
"
L445123,L445123,u2495,m161,STEW,"Outside!
"
L445121,L445121,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, outside!
"
L445117,L445117,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
"
L445115,L445115,u2495,m161,STEW,"Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
"
L445113,L445113,u2495,m161,STEW,"But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
"
L445111,L445111,u2495,m161,STEW,"Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
"
L445108,L445108,u2495,m161,STEW,"What are you doing fooling around in here?
"
L445106,L445106,u2495,m161,STEW,"Did you take anything out of those pants?
"
L445103,L445103,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
"
L445101,L445101,u2495,m161,STEW,"Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
"
L445099,L445099,u2495,m161,STEW,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
"
L445097,L445097,u2495,m161,STEW,"You're my what?
"
L445095,L445095,u2495,m161,STEW,"Who are you?
"
L445094,L445094,u2495,m161,STEW,"I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
"
L445585,L445585,u2495,m161,STEW,"There's nothing sudden about that  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
"
L445583,L445583,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
"
L445581,L445581,u2495,m161,STEW,"The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
"
L445577,L445577,u2495,m161,STEW,"It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this?  The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
"
L445575,L445575,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
"
L445573,L445573,u2495,m161,STEW,"Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
"
L445546,L445546,u2495,m161,STEW,"Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
"
L445544,L445544,u2495,m161,STEW,"Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
"
L445542,L445542,u2495,m161,STEW,"How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
"
L445540,L445540,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hey, Gallagher!
"
L445536,L445536,u2495,m161,STEW,"Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
"
L445493,L445493,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
"
L445491,L445491,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
"
L445477,L445477,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
"
L445475,L445475,u2495,m161,STEW,"You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
"
L445473,L445473,u2495,m161,STEW,"And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
"
L445471,L445471,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
"
L445469,L445469,u2495,m161,STEW,"Right.
"
L445467,L445467,u2495,m161,STEW,"Right.
"
L445463,L445463,u2495,m161,STEW,"What do you know about Conrad?
"
L445461,L445461,u2495,m161,STEW,"Did who?
"
L445459,L445459,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
"
L445457,L445457,u2495,m161,STEW,"Never even been to New Madrid.
"
L445455,L445455,u2495,m161,STEW,"Been where?
"
L445453,L445453,u2495,m161,STEW,"Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
"
L445450,L445450,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
"
L445446,L445446,u2495,m161,STEW,"You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
"
L445434,L445434,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
"
L445432,L445432,u2495,m161,STEW,"I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
"
L445408,L445408,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hello, Hank. How are you?
"
L445406,L445406,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
"
L445247,L445247,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
"
L445245,L445245,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
"
L445234,L445234,u2495,m161,STEW,"Right!
"
L445217,L445217,u2495,m161,STEW,"Must be my wife.
"
L445215,L445215,u2495,m161,STEW,"Staring at us?
"
L445213,L445213,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
"
L445211,L445211,u2495,m161,STEW,"What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
"
L445209,L445209,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
"
L445207,L445207,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
"
L445205,L445205,u2495,m161,STEW,"Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
"
L445203,L445203,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
"
L445201,L445201,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
"
L445030,L445030,u2495,m161,STEW,"Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
"
L445028,L445028,u2495,m161,STEW,"I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
"
L445026,L445026,u2495,m161,STEW,"Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
"
L444985,L444985,u2495,m161,STEW,"Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
"
L444983,L444983,u2495,m161,STEW,"Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
"
L444981,L444981,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
"
L444979,L444979,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
"
L444977,L444977,u2495,m161,STEW,"Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
"
L444975,L444975,u2495,m161,STEW,"Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
"
L444973,L444973,u2495,m161,STEW,"Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
"
L444971,L444971,u2495,m161,STEW,"Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
"
L444969,L444969,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
"
L444967,L444967,u2495,m161,STEW,"Thanks, thanks.
"
L444965,L444965,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
"
L444963,L444963,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
"
L444834,L444834,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
"
L444832,L444832,u2495,m161,STEW,"There you go, talking like a woman!
"
L444830,L444830,u2495,m161,STEW,"Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
"
L444828,L444828,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
"
L444826,L444826,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
"
L444824,L444824,u2495,m161,STEW,"and those and them.
"
L444822,L444822,u2495,m161,STEW,"And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
"
L444820,L444820,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
"
L444818,L444818,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
"
L444816,L444816,u2495,m161,STEW,"I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
"
L444660,L444660,u2495,m161,STEW,"There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
"
L444658,L444658,u2495,m161,STEW,"Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
"
L445571,L445571,u2495,m161,STEW,"And now for that twentieth crack
"
L445569,L445569,u2495,m161,STEW,"Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
"
L445567,L445567,u2495,m161,STEW,"Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
"
L445565,L445565,u2495,m161,STEW,"Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
"
L445563,L445563,u2495,m161,STEW,"Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
"
L445560,L445560,u2495,m161,STEW,"Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
"
L445558,L445558,u2495,m161,STEW,"She did?
"
L445556,L445556,u2495,m161,STEW,"You don't.
"
L445554,L445554,u2495,m161,STEW,"Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
"
L445552,L445552,u2495,m161,STEW,"Surely, come right in.
"
L445550,L445550,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
"
L445548,L445548,u2495,m161,STEW,"Holy jumping swordfish!
"
L445310,L445310,u2495,m161,STEW,"Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
"
L445308,L445308,u2495,m161,STEW,"Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
"
L445306,L445306,u2495,m161,STEW,"You quit trying to stop anybody
"
L444785,L444785,u2495,m161,STEW,"Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
"
L444779,L444779,u2495,m161,STEW,"Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
"
L444775,L444775,u2495,m161,STEW,"Good.
"
L444773,L444773,u2495,m161,STEW,"A statement? Good.
"
L444771,L444771,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
"
L444768,L444768,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
"
L444766,L444766,u2495,m161,STEW,"Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
"
L444764,L444764,u2495,m161,STEW,"Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
"
L445428,L445428,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
"
L445426,L445426,u2495,m161,STEW,"I'm sorry nobody could come.
"
L445416,L445416,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hello, Joe.
"
L445414,L445414,u2495,m161,STEW,"It's all right. Bring him in.
"
L445412,L445412,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure.
"
L445410,L445410,u2495,m161,STEW,"Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
"
L445522,L445522,u2495,m161,STEW,"Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
"
L445520,L445520,u2495,m161,STEW,"Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
"
L445317,L445317,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
"
L445314,L445314,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
"
L445303,L445303,u2495,m161,STEW,"He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
"
L445301,L445301,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes - the worm!
"
L445299,L445299,u2495,m161,STEW,"Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
"
L445052,L445052,u2495,m161,STEW,"All right, Grandma
"
L445047,L445047,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
"
L445045,L445045,u2495,m161,STEW,"Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
"
L444907,L444907,u2495,m161,STEW,"With pleasure, Madame!
"
L444903,L444903,u2495,m161,STEW,"As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
"
L444770,L444770,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
"
L445430,L445430,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
"
L445404,L445404,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
"
L445397,L445397,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's all I wanted to know!
"
L445395,L445395,u2495,m161,STEW,"A bird in a gilded cage?
"
L445393,L445393,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
"
L445391,L445391,u2495,m161,STEW,"How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
"
L445389,L445389,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
"
L445387,L445387,u2495,m161,STEW,"Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
"
L445385,L445385,u2495,m161,STEW,"No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
"
L445382,L445382,u2495,m161,STEW,"Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
"
L445380,L445380,u2495,m161,STEW,"Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
"
L445378,L445378,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
"
L445376,L445376,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
"
L445374,L445374,u2495,m161,STEW,"It's haunted just the same.
"
L445372,L445372,u2495,m161,STEW,"Found no skeletons?
"
L445370,L445370,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
"
L445368,L445368,u2495,m161,STEW,"No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
"
L445366,L445366,u2495,m161,STEW,"Yeah.
"
L445364,L445364,u2495,m161,STEW,"You try it.
"
L445362,L445362,u2495,m161,STEW,"Shhh! Do you hear something?
"
L445361,L445361,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
"
L445281,L445281,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
"
L445280,L445280,u2495,m161,STEW,"That's what I think of it, Bingy!
"
L444850,L444850,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now the lady said you may go
"
L444841,L444841,u2495,m161,STEW,"I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
"
L444839,L444839,u2495,m161,STEW,"Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
"
L444837,L444837,u2495,m161,STEW,"Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
"
L444712,L444712,u2495,m161,STEW,"There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
"
L356762,L356762,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, I'll stay.
"
L356760,L356760,u6378,m425,BOB,"Ok.
"
L356758,L356758,u6378,m425,BOB,"Oh, hi, Elaine.
"
L356756,L356756,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hello?
"
L356472,L356472,u6378,m425,BOB,"Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
"
L356470,L356470,u6378,m425,BOB,"Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
"
L356468,L356468,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, they told me.
"
L356466,L356466,u6378,m425,BOB,"Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
"
L356880,L356880,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I'll miss you.
"
L356879,L356879,u6378,m425,BOB,"Why are you crying?
"
L356876,L356876,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Ok, bye.
"
L356875,L356875,u6378,m425,BOB,"Thanks.
"
L356874,L356874,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Well... have a good flight.
"
L356873,L356873,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yes.
"
L356872,L356872,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You're leaving right now?
"
L356869,L356869,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yes, no.
"
L356868,L356868,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
"
L356862,L356862,u6378,m425,BOB,"That'd be great.
"
L356861,L356861,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
"
L356860,L356860,u6378,m425,BOB,"I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
"
L356859,L356859,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Hi, Bob.
"
L356858,L356858,u6378,m425,BOB,"Charlotte?
"
L356850,L356850,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
"
L356849,L356849,u6378,m425,BOB,"Why can't it last?
"
L356848,L356848,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
"
L356847,L356847,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't want to go back tomorrow.
"
L356844,L356844,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Well, I mean it more now.
"
L356843,L356843,u6378,m425,BOB,"That's what you said the other night.
"
L356842,L356842,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I'm going to miss you.
"
L356841,L356841,u6378,m425,BOB,"Tomorrow.
"
L356840,L356840,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"When are you leaving?
"
L356839,L356839,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"That lunch was the worst, huh.
"
L356838,L356838,u6378,m425,BOB,"I'm sorry.
"
L356836,L356836,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Around.
"
L356835,L356835,u6378,m425,BOB,"So, where'd you go today.
"
L356834,L356834,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"A coke.
"
L356833,L356833,u6378,m425,BOB,"What do you want to drink?
"
L356830,L356830,u6378,m425,BOB,"You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
"
L356829,L356829,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
"
L356827,L356827,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, we'll find something around here.
"
L356826,L356826,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
"
L356805,L356805,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't want to be.
"
L356804,L356804,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
"
L356803,L356803,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yes, but no, I can't right now.
"
L356802,L356802,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
"
L356795,L356795,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"No.
"
L356794,L356794,u6378,m425,BOB,"Do you know where we are?
"
L356793,L356793,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Yeah.
"
L356792,L356792,u6378,m425,BOB,"Do you ever see him?
"
L356791,L356791,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Working.
"
L356790,L356790,u6378,m425,BOB,"Where's your husband?
"
L356747,L356747,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, look at that thing.
"
L356746,L356746,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You think so?
"
L356745,L356745,u6378,m425,BOB,"We should get you to the doctor.
"
L356744,L356744,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"It's bad isn't it?
"
L356742,L356742,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
"
L356741,L356741,u6378,m425,BOB,"What happened to your toe?
"
L356740,L356740,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Fuck off.
"
L356739,L356739,u6378,m425,BOB,"Nice one.
"
L356738,L356738,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, she'll love it.
"
L356737,L356737,u6378,m425,BOB,"Four.
"
L356736,L356736,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"How old is she?
"
L356735,L356735,u6378,m425,BOB,"It's for my daughter.
"
L356733,L356733,u6378,m425,BOB,"They really have to work on that street name thing.
"
L356732,L356732,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You made it.
"
L356724,L356724,u6378,m425,BOB,"Because that would be too easy.
"
L356723,L356723,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
"
L356722,L356722,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I know, but that's what you like about me.
"
L356721,L356721,u6378,m425,BOB,"You are.
"
L356720,L356720,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"John thinks I'm so snotty.
"
L356719,L356719,u6378,m425,BOB,"I know.
"
L356718,L356718,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
"
L356717,L356717,u6378,m425,BOB,"Where'd you grow up?
"
L356716,L356716,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
"
L356715,L356715,u6378,m425,BOB,"But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
"
L356714,L356714,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"No one ever tells you that...
"
L356713,L356713,u6378,m425,BOB,"When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
"
L356712,L356712,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"That's too scary.
"
L356711,L356711,u6378,m425,BOB,"We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
"
L356710,L356710,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh.
"
L356709,L356709,u6378,m425,BOB,"We established that we have no communication.
"
L356708,L356708,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Did that help? Did you learn anything?
"
L356707,L356707,u6378,m425,BOB,"It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
"
L356706,L356706,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"And marriage, does that get easier?
"
L356705,L356705,u6378,m425,BOB,"That's ok.
"
L356704,L356704,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"But, I'm mean.
"
L356703,L356703,u6378,m425,BOB,"You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
"
L356702,L356702,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
"
L356701,L356701,u6378,m425,BOB,"Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
"
L356700,L356700,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Yeah? But look at you.
"
L356699,L356699,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, yes, it does...
"
L356698,L356698,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
"
L356697,L356697,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I know.
"
L356696,L356696,u6378,m425,BOB,"You're possessive.
"
L356695,L356695,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh.
"
L356694,L356694,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
"
L356693,L356693,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, for her show?
"
L356692,L356692,u6378,m425,BOB,"I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
"
L356691,L356691,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
"
L356690,L356690,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, I was looking at you.
"
L356689,L356689,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
"
L356688,L356688,u6378,m425,BOB,"Ok, whatever you want.
"
L356687,L356687,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
"
L356686,L356686,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't know. My fax said ""have a good fright"".
"
L356685,L356685,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
"
L356684,L356684,u6378,m425,BOB,"I know, I kind of blend in here.
"
L356683,L356683,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I don't remember.
"
L356682,L356682,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, you smiled.
"
L356681,L356681,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Did I scowl at you?
"
L356680,L356680,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, you don't remember?
"
L356679,L356679,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Really?
"
L356678,L356678,u6378,m425,BOB,"But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
"
L356677,L356677,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
"
L356676,L356676,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't know.
"
L356675,L356675,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
"
L356674,L356674,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, its easy.
"
L356673,L356673,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
"
L356672,L356672,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hans was very attentive to you.
"
L356671,L356671,u6378,m425,BOB,"I see them every morning.
"
L356670,L356670,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Hey look, it's Sausalito.
"
L356669,L356669,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"OK, see you downstairs.
"
L356668,L356668,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
"
L356667,L356667,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Do you want to have some breakfast?
"
L356666,L356666,u6378,m425,BOB,"Of course.
"
L356665,L356665,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
"
L356664,L356664,u6378,m425,BOB,"Charlotte, who?
"
L356663,L356663,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"It's Charlotte.
"
L356662,L356662,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hello?
"
L356645,L356645,u6378,m425,BOB,"I know. I don't either.
"
L356644,L356644,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I don't want to go home.
"
L356638,L356638,u6378,m425,BOB,"Ok.
"
L356637,L356637,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I could cut the ones that are left for you.
"
L356635,L356635,u6378,m425,BOB,"No way.
"
L356634,L356634,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"What do you feel like singing, Bob?
"
L356624,L356624,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hi, Charlie.
"
L356623,L356623,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
"
L356621,L356621,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"No.
"
L356620,L356620,u6378,m425,BOB,"A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
"
L356619,L356619,u6378,m425,BOB,"I know, it's stupid.
"
L356618,L356618,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You really are having a mid-life crisis.
"
L356616,L356616,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"See you later.
"
L356615,L356615,u6378,m425,BOB,"Ok.
"
L356614,L356614,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
"
L356613,L356613,u6378,m425,BOB,"I'm here for the week.
"
L356612,L356612,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Not really. How long are you here for?
"
L356611,L356611,u6378,m425,BOB,"No, how about you?
"
L356610,L356610,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
"
L356609,L356609,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
"
L356608,L356608,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh, hi.
"
L356559,L356559,u6378,m425,BOB,"Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
"
L356558,L356558,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Hi again, how's it going?
"
L356507,L356507,u6378,m425,BOB,"Thanks.
"
L356506,L356506,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
"
L356505,L356505,u6378,m425,BOB,"It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
"
L356504,L356504,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
"
L356503,L356503,u6378,m425,BOB,"Oh, what do you do with that?
"
L356502,L356502,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Philosophy.
"
L356501,L356501,u6378,m425,BOB,"What did you study?
"
L356500,L356500,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
"
L356499,L356499,u6378,m425,BOB,"What do you do?
"
L356498,L356498,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh.
"
L356497,L356497,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
"
L356496,L356496,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
"
L356495,L356495,u6378,m425,BOB,"I'm thinking about it.
"
L356494,L356494,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
"
L356493,L356493,u6378,m425,BOB,"Try twenty-five.
"
L356492,L356492,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Two years.
"
L356491,L356491,u6378,m425,BOB,"How long have you been married?
"
L356490,L356490,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
"
L356489,L356489,u6378,m425,BOB,"What about you? Why are you here?
"
L356486,L356486,u6378,m425,BOB,"My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
"
L356485,L356485,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"What are you doing here?
"
L356452,L356452,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yes?
"
L356449,L356449,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't think so.
"
L356447,L356447,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yes?
"
L356444,L356444,u6378,m425,BOB,"Oh?

"
L356819,L356819,u6378,m425,BOB,"That's ok.
"
L356816,L356816,u6378,m425,BOB,"Yeah.
"
L356814,L356814,u6378,m425,BOB,"What?
"
L356812,L356812,u6378,m425,BOB,"It's ok.
"
L356810,L356810,u6378,m425,BOB,"I couldn't hear you. How are you?
"
L356808,L356808,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hello?
"
L356806,L356806,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hello?

"
L356782,L356782,u6378,m425,BOB,"Like Japanese food.
"
L356780,L356780,u6378,m425,BOB,"Not all that pasta.
"
L356778,L356778,u6378,m425,BOB,"You know, eat healthier.
"
L356776,L356776,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
"
L356774,L356774,u6378,m425,BOB,"I don't know.
"
L356772,L356772,u6378,m425,BOB,"That's not what I'm talking about.
"
L356770,L356770,u6378,m425,BOB,"Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
"
L356768,L356768,u6378,m425,BOB,"Uh, no.

"
L356650,L356650,u6378,m425,BOB,"He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
"
L356648,L356648,u6378,m425,BOB,"Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
"
L356646,L356646,u6378,m425,BOB,"Lydia?
"
L356854,L356854,u6378,m425,BOB,"Hello, can I have room 5601.

"
L356602,L356602,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Are you sure you have to go?
"
L356599,L356599,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
"
L356596,L356596,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
"
L356594,L356594,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
"
L356592,L356592,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Ok, I will... later.
"
L356590,L356590,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
"
L356587,L356587,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Do you think it's done?
"
L356585,L356585,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Yeah.
"
L356573,L356573,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Bye.

"
L356567,L356567,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Like popcorn?
"
L356565,L356565,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"You smell weird.
"
L356563,L356563,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I don't know what to do.
"
L356561,L356561,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.

"
L356531,L356531,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
"
L356529,L356529,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Why do you have to defend her?
"
L356526,L356526,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"Evelyn Waugh was a man.

"
L356576,L356576,u6379,m425,CHARLOTTE,"It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I.

L455431,L455431,u2521,m163,LENA,"I'm fine are you ok?
"
L455430,L455430,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Are you ok?
"
L455428,L455428,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I thought that you were anyway.
"
L455427,L455427,u2521,m163,LENA,"It's ok to ask that.
"
L455426,L455426,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah.
"
L455425,L455425,u2521,m163,LENA,"Can I come home with you when we get there?
"
L455424,L455424,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I forgot about that.
"
L455422,L455422,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455421,L455421,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's right you travel so much.
"
L455420,L455420,u2521,m163,LENA,"I think maybe over a hundred.
"
L455419,L455419,u2511,m163,BARRY,"How many times have you been on an airplane?
"
L455418,L455418,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
"
L455417,L455417,u2521,m163,LENA,"For work.....
"
L455416,L455416,u2511,m163,BARRY,"For what?
"
L455415,L455415,u2521,m163,LENA,"Where do you have to go?
"
L455393,L455393,u2511,m163,BARRY,"This is nice.
"
L455392,L455392,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455391,L455391,u2511,m163,BARRY,"This is funny.
"
L455390,L455390,u2521,m163,LENA,"I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
"
L455389,L455389,u2511,m163,BARRY,"IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
"
L455388,L455388,u2521,m163,LENA,"...what...?
"
L455387,L455387,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
"
L455386,L455386,u2521,m163,LENA,"I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
"
L455385,L455385,u2511,m163,BARRY,"What's that? What is that that you're doing?
"
L455384,L455384,u2521,m163,LENA,"Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
"
L455382,L455382,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455381,L455381,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Do you wanna have sex?
"
L455379,L455379,u2511,m163,BARRY,"This really looks like Hawaii here.
"
L455378,L455378,u2521,m163,LENA,"It's so nice.
"
L455377,L455377,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah......yeah.....
"
L455376,L455376,u2521,m163,LENA,"You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
"
L455375,L455375,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Ok. Where are you from originally?
"
L455374,L455374,u2521,m163,LENA,"Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
"
L455373,L455373,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Ok. So you were married for how long?
"
L455372,L455372,u2521,m163,LENA,"yeah.
"
L455371,L455371,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Where you married?
"
L455370,L455370,u2521,m163,LENA,"When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
"
L455369,L455369,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I just wanted to make sure.
"
L455368,L455368,u2521,m163,LENA,"About six months ago. Why?
"
L455367,L455367,u2521,m163,LENA,"No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
"
L455366,L455366,u2511,m163,BARRY,"You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
"
L455365,L455365,u2521,m163,LENA,"Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
"
L455364,L455364,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
"
L455363,L455363,u2521,m163,LENA,"OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
"
L455362,L455362,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes.

"
L455243,L455243,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Have a good trip.
"
L455242,L455242,u2521,m163,LENA,"Ok.
"
L455241,L455241,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I don't freak out.
"
L455240,L455240,u2521,m163,LENA,"...I don't know what you mean....
"
L455239,L455239,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
"
L455238,L455238,u2521,m163,LENA,"What do you mean?
"
L455237,L455237,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I don't freak out very often.
"
L455236,L455236,u2521,m163,LENA,"Ok.
"
L455235,L455235,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I'll see you later.
"
L455234,L455234,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455233,L455233,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That was good.
"
L455232,L455232,u2511,m163,BARRY,"So what do I do then?
"
L455231,L455231,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455230,L455230,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Really?
"
L455229,L455229,u2521,m163,LENA,"I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
"
L455228,L455228,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Hi.
"
L455227,L455227,u2521,m163,LENA,"This is Lena.
"
L455226,L455226,u2511,m163,BARRY,"This is Barry.
"
L455222,L455222,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Ok. Have a good trip.
"
L455221,L455221,u2521,m163,LENA,"Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
"
L455220,L455220,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I don't know.
"
L455219,L455219,u2521,m163,LENA,"You don't think you'll go --
"
L455218,L455218,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
"
L455217,L455217,u2521,m163,LENA,"If you come to Hawaii --
"
L455216,L455216,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yeah.
"
L455215,L455215,u2521,m163,LENA,"I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
"
L455214,L455214,u2511,m163,BARRY,"It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
"
L455213,L455213,u2521,m163,LENA,"...yeah...
"
L455212,L455212,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
"
L455211,L455211,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes no not really.
"
L455210,L455210,u2521,m163,LENA,"So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
"
L455209,L455209,u2521,m163,LENA,"Oh that's great.
"
L455208,L455208,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes? I'm trying.
"
L455207,L455207,u2521,m163,LENA,"Are you learning how to play it?
"
L455206,L455206,u2511,m163,BARRY,"...yes I did...?
"
L455205,L455205,u2521,m163,LENA,"Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
"
L455204,L455204,u2511,m163,BARRY,"What?
"
L455203,L455203,u2521,m163,LENA,"Did you pick it up from the street?
"
L455202,L455202,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Well, it's fine. Thank you.
"
L455201,L455201,u2521,m163,LENA,"Your portable reed organ....the piano.
"
L455199,L455199,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
"
L455198,L455198,u2521,m163,LENA,"Did something happen; are you alright?
"
L455197,L455197,u2511,m163,BARRY,"There's a better place for us to eat.
"
L455196,L455196,u2521,m163,LENA,"Ok.
"
L455195,L455195,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I have a better idea of where we can go.
"
L455194,L455194,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Nothing.
"
L455193,L455193,u2521,m163,LENA,"What did he want?
"
L455192,L455192,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Nothing.
"
L455191,L455191,u2521,m163,LENA,"What happened?
"
L455190,L455190,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes.
"
L455189,L455189,u2521,m163,LENA,"Is everything ok?
"
L455148,L455148,u2521,m163,LENA,"Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
"
L455147,L455147,u2511,m163,BARRY,"My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
"
L455146,L455146,u2521,m163,LENA,"I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
"
L455145,L455145,u2511,m163,BARRY,"No I didn't say that.
"
L455144,L455144,u2521,m163,LENA,"I'm sorry. I thought you said --
"
L455143,L455143,u2511,m163,BARRY,"....No....
"
L455142,L455142,u2521,m163,LENA,"So that was your pudding?
"
L455141,L455141,u2511,m163,BARRY,"....yeah....
"
L455140,L455140,u2521,m163,LENA,"That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
"
L455139,L455139,u2511,m163,BARRY,"You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
"
L455138,L455138,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah, no, I see --
"
L455137,L455137,u2511,m163,BARRY,"You see?
"
L455136,L455136,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455135,L455135,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
"
L455134,L455134,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455133,L455133,u2511,m163,BARRY,"-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
"
L455132,L455132,u2521,m163,LENA,"You were talking about the promotion --
"
L455131,L455131,u2511,m163,BARRY,"....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
"
L455130,L455130,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah?
"
L455129,L455129,u2511,m163,BARRY,"So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
"
L455128,L455128,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455127,L455127,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
"
L455126,L455126,u2521,m163,LENA,"No, no. I did.
"
L455125,L455125,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
"
L455124,L455124,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
"
L455123,L455123,u2511,m163,BARRY,"You like her?
"
L455122,L455122,u2521,m163,LENA,"About six months.
"
L455121,L455121,u2511,m163,BARRY,"How long have you known her?
"
L455120,L455120,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455119,L455119,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
"
L455118,L455118,u2521,m163,LENA,"...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
"
L455117,L455117,u2511,m163,BARRY,"...really? That's nice...are you lying?
"
L455114,L455114,u2511,m163,BARRY,"It's Barry.
"
L455113,L455113,u2521,m163,LENA,"Who is it?
"
L455060,L455060,u2511,m163,BARRY,"....Hi.....
"
L455059,L455059,u2521,m163,LENA,"....Hi.....
"
L455058,L455058,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Alright?
"
L455057,L455057,u2521,m163,LENA,"Ok.
"
L455056,L455056,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
"
L455055,L455055,u2521,m163,LENA,"Yeah.
"
L455054,L455054,u2511,m163,BARRY,"This is funny.
"
L455053,L455053,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Sure.
"
L455052,L455052,u2521,m163,LENA,"Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
"
L455051,L455051,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Sure.
"
L455050,L455050,u2521,m163,LENA,"Do you want to pick me up?
"
L455049,L455049,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Sure.
"
L455048,L455048,u2521,m163,LENA,"I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
"
L455036,L455036,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Ok.
"
L455035,L455035,u2521,m163,LENA,"It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
"
L455029,L455029,u2511,m163,BARRY,"-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
"
L455028,L455028,u2521,m163,LENA,"-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
"
L455027,L455027,u2511,m163,BARRY,"-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
"
L455026,L455026,u2521,m163,LENA,"-- well, if you're gonna go --
"
L455025,L455025,u2511,m163,BARRY,"I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
"
L455024,L455024,u2521,m163,LENA,"Really?
"
L455023,L455023,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
"
L455020,L455020,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Are you guys hurt?
"
L455019,L455019,u2521,m163,LENA,"Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
"
L455018,L455018,u2511,m163,BARRY,"It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
"
L455017,L455017,u2521,m163,LENA,"Oh My God.
"
L455016,L455016,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
"
L455015,L455015,u2521,m163,LENA,"What do you do with all this pudding?
"
L455014,L455014,u2521,m163,LENA,"It's terrible, no.
"
L455013,L455013,u2511,m163,BARRY,"That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
"
L455012,L455012,u2521,m163,LENA,"No. I'm the exact opposite --
"
L455011,L455011,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Do you have brothers or sisters?
"
L455010,L455010,u2511,m163,BARRY,"Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
"

"
L455000,L455000,u2521,m163,LENA,"It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
"
L454999,L454999,u2511,m163,BARRY,"It's fine. It was fun, though.
"
L454998,L454998,u2521,m163,LENA,"I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --

"
L454586,L454586,u2521,m163,LENA,"You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
"
L454585,L454585,u2521,m163,LENA,"Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.

"
L454581,L454581,u2521,m163,LENA,"I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
"

"
L454579,L454579,u2521,m163,LENA,"Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
"
L454578,L454578,u2511,m163,BARRY,"They don't get opened until eight.
"
L454577,L454577,u2521,m163,LENA,"They're not open yet?
