# MountainMadnessHackathon2021

Hi there!

Our original plan going into this project was to make a chat bot which uses deep learning to simulate a grilfriend in the spirit of Valentines Day named after the popular Manga, Rent a Girlfriend. We gathered movie script data to use for our conversations and spent the first 6 hours of the hackathon cleaning and processing the data. We then attempted to train our own model which lead us down dead end to dead end. Although we learned a lot, in the end we ended up having to abandon this deep learning project. Instead we decided to provide our own data_set to a model we found online. This is our Rent a Girlfriend bot, trained by us. 

The model we used was from this article here: https://towardsdatascience.com/generative-chatbots-using-the-seq2seq-model-d411c8738ab5

Try asking her some things you would ask your own girlfriend!

Instructions:

* Disclaimer: Unfortunately there are a lot of requirements to running this file. We understand that you did not want to download anything, so if you do not run this program, we understand. We learned a lot from working with deep learning over the course of the last 24 hours and still thank you for the opportunity either way.

* Requirements: pip install pandas, pip install regex, pip install tensorflow, pip install numpy, pip install keras, pip install jupyter
* The name of our file is chatbot.ipynb
* Open up Jupyter Notebook, by running "jupyter notebook"
* Run all the cells in sequence
* You will see a chat box pop up in the second to last cell
* feel free to type anything into this box (although the results may not be accurate)
