# MountainMadnessHackathon2021

Hi there!

Our original plan going into this project was to make a chat bot which uses deep learning to simulate a grilfriend in the spirit of Valentines Day named after the popular Manga, Rent a Girlfriend. We gathered movie script data to use for our conversations and spent the first 6 hours of the hackathon cleaning and processing the data. We then attempted to train our own model which lead us down dead end to dead end. ALthough we learned a lot, in the end we ended up having to abandon this deep learning project. Instead we decided to provide our own data_set to a model we found online. This is our Rent a Girlfriend bot, trained by us. 

Try asking her some things you would ask your own girlfriend!
